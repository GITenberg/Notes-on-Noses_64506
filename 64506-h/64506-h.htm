  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>With regard to a Preface to his Book, an Author
has to contend with three great, but unequal, difficulties.
The first and greatest, is to persuade his
Publisher to issue it without a Preface; the next,
is to write one himself; and the third and least, is
to get some one to write it for him. Now there is a
wise old saw which says, “Of divers evils choose the
least;” and as the learned Slawkenbergius (so says
Tristram Shandy) has prefaced his FOLIO on Noses
with a clause which exactly explains our own qualifications
and reasons for writing on the same important
subject, we invoke him to relieve us of the
third difficulty: “‘ever since I understood,’ quoth
Slawkenbergius, ‘anything—or rather <em>what was what</em>,—and
could perceive that the point of Long Noses
had been too loosely handled by all who had gone
before—have I, Slawkenbergius, felt a strong impulse,
with a mighty and irresistible call within me,
to gird up myself to this undertaking.’”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_iv'>iv</span>Now this is exactly our own case, and must,
therefore, suffice for our Preface; nevertheless, we
cannot flatter ourselves that our brief hints will be
eulogized, like the gigantic folio of Hafen Slawkenbergius,
as “an institute of all that is necessary to
be known of Noses.” It professes to be nothing
more than an introduction to the subject of Nasology;
written originally for the use of friends, and afterwards
extended for publication. This will account
for some discrepancies which may be perceptible in
the style—discrepancies which it was thought best
not to remove, as the additions were on subjects of
a more grave and important character than the
original sketch; and, therefore, the diversities of
style appeared to be rather consistent and advantageous.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>It has not been hastily, nor until after long and careful
observation, that the theory propounded in the following
pages has been published; a theory which, at first sight,
may appear to some wild and absurd, to others simply ridiculous,
to others wicked and heretical,<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c012'><sup>[1]</sup></a> and to others
fraught with social mischief and danger.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nevertheless, we shall not begin by deprecating the ridicule
or the censure of any one. The only vindication
which an author is entitled to offer, is that which his works
themselves present. If his cause be a good one, it requires
no apology; if it be a bad one, to vindicate it is either useless
or baneful; useless, if it blind no one to his errors;
baneful, if it induce any one blindly to receive his brass
for sterling gold.</p>

<p class='c007'>The only circumstance which can attach any value to
our observations is, that they are entirely original, and
wholly unbiassed by the theories of any other writers on
physiognomy. When we commenced observing Noses, we
just knew that some few forms of the Nose had names
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>given them, as the Roman, the Greek, &amp;c.; but we regarded
these as mere artistic definitions of form, and were wholly
ignorant what mental characteristics had been ascribed to
them. So far as this nomenclature went, it appeared best
to adopt it, as affording well-known designations of Nasal
profiles; and our investigations were, therefore, commenced
by endeavouring to discover whether these from
of Nose characterised any, and what, mental properties.
In order to do this with accuracy, it was absolutely necessary
still to keep the mind unacquainted with the system
of any other writers, if such there were, lest it should unconsciously
imbibe preconceptions and hints which would
render its independent researches open to the suspicion
of bias. We felt that if the characteristics attributed by
us to Noses, after long and extensive observation, corresponded
with those of any other writer, a powerful corroboration
of our views would thus be gained.</p>

<p class='c007'>It may happen, therefore (and it is hoped it will be so)
that we may sometimes appear to have plagiarised from
other physiognomists, and to have adopted their views;
but this correspondence must, nevertheless, be accepted as
a further proof of the accuracy of their and our honest independent
labours.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was impossible, however, amidst much multifarious
reading, to keep the mind, latterly, wholly ignorant that
some mental characteristics had been ascribed to Noses;
but into the nature of these we never inquired, nor are we
aware that anything has been done, beyond throwing out
a few unconnected, unattested hints, towards a systematic
deduction of mental qualifications from Nasal formation.</p>

<p class='c007'>If it is improper to vindicate one’s self, it might not
seem altogether unfitting to vindicate one’s subject from
ridicule; and it might appear prudent, if not altogether
necessary, to commence by vindicating the Nose from the
charge of being too ridiculous an organ to be seriously discoursed
upon. But this ridiculousness is mere prejudice;
intrinsically one part of the face is as worthy as another,
and we may feel assured that He who gave the <i><span lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">os sublime</span></i>
to man, did not place, as its foremost and most prominent
feature, a <em>ridiculous</em> appendage.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>But this prejudice ought not to weigh with any thinking
mind. If it is true—as Dr. Prichard asserts, and as
every ethnologist admits—that protruding jaws indicate a
low state of civilisation, an animal and degraded mind, is
it more ridiculous to assert that the flat, depressed Nose,
which always accompanies the prognathous jaws, is likewise
an indication of a similar mind? If it is true that
the oval form of head indicates a high-class of mind, and
a capacity for the highest civilisation, is it absurd to
assert that the Romano-Greek Nose, which generally accompanies,
and is characteristic of that form of head, is
likewise indicative of a similar mind? Nasology is
strictly in harmony with the deductions of the ablest
physiognomists and ethnologists. It contradicts no laws
which have been established between mind and matter; on
the contrary, it upholds, supports, and maintains the investigations
of the ablest writers on anthropology, and has
only not been touched upon by them, because the necessity
they are under of forming many of their deductions
from skulls, precludes their making the soft parts of the
face a standard of comparison.</p>

<p class='c007'>To come then at once to our subject. We have a belief,
founded on long-continued, personal observation, that
there is more in a Nose than most owners of that appendage
are generally aware. We believe that, besides being
an ornament to the face, a breathing apparatus, or a convenient
handle by which to grasp an impudent fellow, it
is an important index to its owner’s character; and that
the accurate observation and minute comparison of an extensive
collection of Noses of persons whose mental characteristics
are known, justifies a Nasal Classification, and
a deduction of some points of mental organisation therefrom.
It will not be contended that all the faculties and
properties of mind are revealed by the Nose;—for instance,
we can read nothing of Temper or the Passions
from it.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c012'><sup>[2]</sup></a> Perhaps it rather reveals Power and Taste—Power
or Energy to carry out Ideas, and the Taste or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>Inclination which dictates or guides them. As these will
always very much form a man’s outward character, the
proposition which is sought to be established is this:—“<span class='sc'>The
Nose is an important Index to Character</span>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It may be prudent to observe that we utterly repudiate
the doctrine of the Phrenologists, that the form of the Body
affects the manifestations, and even properties, of the
Mind.</p>

<p class='c007'>We contend that the Mind forms the Nose, and not the
Nose the Mind. We have carefully endeavoured to avoid
phraseology which should induce a supposition that we
entertain the latter absurdity; but here enter this protest
once for all, lest a want of precision in our language, or
the obtuseness of critics, should cause us to be charged
with it.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is in vain to require proof of a material connection
between the Nose and the Mind, for it is utterly impossible
to demonstrate to sense the seat of the divine particle.
Material organs cannot apprehend immaterial
existence: they even fail to perceive some of the more
tenuous materialisms, air, light, heat, electricity, &amp;c.,
which are known only by their effects. It is in vain to
deny physiognomy—of which Nasology is only a department—because
we cannot understand by what processes
mind acts on the features; because we cannot see any
material organisms which operate to contract the muscles
in laughter or pain, or which impel the blood to or from
the countenance when consciousness or fear affects the
mind. It is in vain to deny the blush or the pallor
because we know not <em>how</em> the pulsations of the heart and
the flow of blood are affected by mental impressions. It
is one of the strongest proofs of the immateriality of the
soul, that while its existence cannot be denied, it cannot be
anatomically demonstrated, nor rendered visible to sense.
The mode in which Mind acts on Matter is one of the
arcana of Nature, which, perhaps, human science will
never penetrate. It is a secret reserved for that state in
which the mind will act independently of material media.
However numerous and plausible the theories propounded
to explain the mystery, they all terminate like the Indian’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>world-supports, and the chain of connection breaks at the
last link. It is, therefore, in vain to deny physiognomy
because we can demonstrate no material connection
between the mind and the features, nor would any sane
objector insist on such demonstration; yet such demonstration
has been insisted on, and the absence of it adduced
as a fundamental objection both to physiognomy and
phrenology by critics at a loss for valid objections.</p>

<p class='c007'>And here we might descant, at considerable length, and
with much show of learning, on the influence of the Mind
over the Body. We might impugn the wisdom of those
who, undertaking to cure either, have forgotten that they
were so intimately united and mutually dependent, that
they could not be treated separately with success. We
might show that the first step of the physician towards
curing mental disorder, is to free the body from disease;
and that of him who would cure the body, is, ofttimes, to
apply his remedies to the derangement of the mind. But,
though by so doing we might swell our pages and eke out
an additional chapter—an important consideration if we
were a mere book-maker—we shall not, as we have some
qualms of conscience whether it would be quite germane to
the matter in hand. It might not, however, be out of
place to remind the reader that physiognomy, or the form
which mind gives to the features, is universally recognised.
A pleasant mouth, a merry eye, a sour visage, a stern
aspect, are some of the common phrases by which we daily
acknowledge ourselves to be physiognomists; for by these
expressions we mean, not that the mouth is pleasant or the
visage sour, but that such is the mind which shines out
from them. If it were the face alone which we thus intended,
we should never trouble or concern ourselves about
a human countenance, nor be attracted, nor repulsed by
one, any more than if it were a carved head on a gothic
waterspout, or a citizen’s door-knocker. We all acknowledge
the impression given by the mind to the mouth and
the eyes because they express Temper and the Passions—those
feelings which more immediately interest us in our
mutual intercourse—and because they change with the
feelings; now flashing with anger, or sparkling with pleasure,
compressing with rage, or smiling with delight.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>But because the Nose is uninfluenced by the feelings
which agitate and vary the mind, and, is, therefore, immovable
and unvaried, no one will hear the theory of
Nasology broached without incredulity and risibility.
Because the Nose is subject only to those faculties of mind
which are permanent and unfluctuating; and is, therefore,
likewise permanent and unfluctuating in its form, men have
paid no attention to its indications, and will, accordingly,
abuse as an empiric and dotard the first Nasologist. But,
is there, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à priori</span></i>, any thing so unreasonable in attributing
mental characteristics to the Nose, when we all daily read
each other’s minds in the Nose’s next-door neighbours,
the eyes and mouth? Is not the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à priori</span></i> inference entirely
in favour of a negative reply? And that, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à posteriori</span></i>, it
may confidently be replied to in the negative will, it is
hoped, presently appear.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is here room for another long disquisition to point
out the advantages of Nasology. How that the permanency
and immobility of the Nose forbid hypocrisy to
mould it to any artificial feelings, as the eyes and the
mouth may be. And how this immobility, together with
its prominency and incapability of being concealed, like
bad phrenological bumps, render it a sure guide to some
parts of our fellow-creatures’ mental organization. But it
would be premature to do this before proving somewhat of
the truth of Nasology; and when that is done, no one will
deny that it has its uses, though it may be disputed what
those are.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nevertheless, we must earnestly protest against the
fallacy of attempting to judge what any person <em>is</em> from his
Nose; we can only judge of natural tendency and capacity—education
and external circumstances of a thousand
different kinds, may have swerved the mind from its
original tendency, or prevented the development of inherent
faculties. It is in this unfair and uncharitable asserting
dogmatically the disposition and character, vices and
virtues, of a man, that phrenologists so greatly err; whereas
they ought to confine their inferences from external development
of organs, to capacity and tendency only.</p>

<p class='c007'>The impossibility of giving such numerous pictorial
illustrations as the subject properly demands, will confine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>the examples adduced to those only of which portraits are
well known and easily accessible. If, therefore, the proofs
are thought insufficient in number, it must be attributed to
this circumstance alone. It would have been easy to have
swelled them by a number of names, the right of which
to be included in the lists the majority of persons would
have been unable to verify. Nevertheless, the examples
will be found much more numerous and more easily verifiable
than those which have been deemed sufficient to
establish Phrenology as an hypothesis, if not as a science;
and, had we, like the principal expounder of Phrenology,<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c012'><sup>[3]</sup></a>
dragged in as ‘proofs’ nameless gentlemen of our acquaintance,
we might have still further extended the lists
of examples. But it seemed to our humble judgment, to
be demanding more from the reader’s good nature than
would be compatible with sound criticism, to ask him to
accept such unsupported <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">dicta</span></i> as <em>proofs</em>. Of course, very
many of the examples by which our own mind has been
satisfied have been drawn from personal observation,
among friends and acquaintance; and not only have these
been the most numerous proofs, but also by far the most
satisfactory, as they afforded the most exact and undeniable
profiles, and the most noticeable mental characteristics.
The slightest incorrectness in the artist, may render
useless a pictorial example; but when we are looking upon
the original itself, there can be no mistake. A thousand
minutiæ of character may escape a biographer, which
appear plainly in the man himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nevertheless, we felt so strongly how unfitting it would
be to offer such mere personal observations as <em>proofs</em>, that
we have carefully refrained from admitting any example
which is not open to the observation of almost every one.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is<a id='t7'></a> a drawback which we feel greatly; it reduces our
instances to a hundredth part of those which might be
adduced; but we must submit to it, only asking of the
reader’s generosity to take it into account. Another
favour which we beg is, that the reader will suspend his
judgment until the subject is concluded, and he has the
whole system, with all its proofs, before him.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>We scruple not to admit, that at present the system is
incomplete. We rather court inquiry, and solicit additional
facts, than peremptorily dogmatize on conclusions
drawn from our own limited—though extensive—number
of observations. But it is so much the fashion for every
wild theorist to dogmatize on his theory, and insist upon
it, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per fas et nefas</span></i>, as perfect, unassailable, and complete,
that it is almost deemed reprehensible to suggest a notion
for the consideration of the world, or to propound anything
which the author is modest enough to admit is
improvable. Such, however, was not the manner of the
true philosophers of former days. If Copernicus had
delayed propounding the system of the universe which
bears his name, until he could explain by it all the planetary
and sidereal motions, it might have slumbered unknown
for another century or two, and so we should not yet have
arrived at our present enlarged understanding of it. If
Bacon had waited for a complete Natural History, ere he
published his Novum Organum, we might still have been
groping after the Sciences with the dark lantern of
Aristotle and the schools. If Newton had withheld his
theory of Light until he could burn a diamond, our knowledge
of the nature of light might still be in its infancy.</p>

<p class='c007'>These examples must furnish an apology for submitting
for candid consideration and further development, a theory
which we believe to be well-founded, but which is capable
of improvement and extension.</p>

<p class='c006'>Subject to the foregoing remarks, the following Physical
Classification of Noses<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c012'><sup>[4]</sup></a> is submitted, as being, in part,
well-known and long-established, because well-defined and

which will at first embarrass the student, but
which, after a little practice, he will be able to distinguish
with tolerable precision. A compound of different Noses
will of course indicate a compound character; and it is
only in the rather rare instance of a perfect Nose of any
of the classes that we find a character correspondingly
strongly developed. We shall endeavour to support each
part of the hypothesis by well-defined and striking
instances, selecting the most decided and perfect noses of
each class, and at the same time the most peculiar and
decided characters.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Class I. The Roman</span>, or Aquiline Nose,
is rather convex, but undulating, as its name
aquiline imports. It is usually rugose and
coarse; but when otherwise, it approaches the
Greek nose, and the character is materially
altered.</p>

<p class='c007'>It indicates great decision, considerable
Energy, Firmness, Absence of Refinement, and
Disregard for the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bienséances</span></i> of life.</p>

<div  class='figleft id002'>

</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Class II. The Greek</span>, or Straight Nose, is
perfectly straight; any deviation from the right
line must be strictly noticed. If the deviation
tend to convexity, it approaches the Roman
Nose, and the character is improved by an accession
of energy; on the other hand, when the
deviation is towards concavity, it partakes of
the “Celestial,” and the character is weakened.
It should be fine and well chiselled, but not sharp.</p>

<p class='c007'>It indicates Refinement of character, Love for the fine
arts and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">belles-lettres</span></i>, Astuteness, Craft, and a preference
for indirect, rather than direct action. Its owner is not
without some energy in pursuit of that which is agreeable
to his tastes; but, unlike the owner of the Roman Nose,
he cannot exert himself in <em>opposition</em> to his tastes. When
associated with the Roman Nose, and distended slightly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>at the end by the Cogitative, it indicates the most useful
and intellectual of characters; and is the highest and most
beautiful form which the organ can assume.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c012'><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Class III. The Cogitative</span>, or Wide-nostrilled
Nose, is, as its secondary name imports,
wide at the end, thick and broad; not clubbed,
but <em>gradually</em> widening from below the bridge.
The other noses are seen in profile, but this in
full face.</p>

<p class='c007'>It indicates a Cogitative mind, having strong
powers of Thought, and given to close and
serious Meditation. Its indications are, of
course, much dependent on the form of the Nose in
profile, which decides the turn the cogitative power will
take. Of course, it never occurs alone; and is usually
associated with Classes I and II, rarely with IV, still
more seldom with V and VI.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c012'><sup>[6]</sup></a> The entire absence of
it produces the “sharp” nose, which is not classified, as
sharpness is only a negative quality, being the defect of
breadth,<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c012'><sup>[7]</sup></a> and, therefore, indicates defect of cogitative
power.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Class IV. The Jewish</span>, or Hawk Nose, is
very convex, and preserves its convexity like
a bow, throughout the whole length from the
eyes to the tip. It is thin and sharp.</p>

<p class='c007'>It indicates considerable Shrewdness in worldly
matters; a deep insight into character, and
facility of turning that insight to profitable
account.</p>

<div  class='figleft id003'>
<img src='images/i_p011b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Classes V and VI. The Snub Nose</span>,
and the Turn-up, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">poeticè</span></i> <span class='sc'>Celestial</span>
Nose. The form of the former is sufficiently
indicated by its name. The latter
is distinguished by its presenting a
continuous concavity from the eyes to
the tip. It is converse in shape to the
Jewish nose.</p>

<p class='c006'>N.B. The Celestial must not be confounded with a
Nose which, belonging to one of the other classes in the
upper part, terminates in a slight distension of the tip; for
this, so far from prejudicing the character, rather adds to
it warmth and activity.</p>

<p class='c007'>We associate the Snub and the Celestial in nearly the
same category, as they both indicate natural weakness,
mean, disagreeable disposition, with petty insolence, and
divers other characteristics of conscious weakness, which
strongly assimilate them (indeed, a true Celestial Nose is
only a Snub turned up); while their general poverty of
distinctive character, makes it almost impossible to distinguish
them. Nevertheless there is a difference between
their indications; arising, however, rather from difference
of intensity than of character. The Celestial is, by virtue
of its greater length, decidedly preferable to the Snub; as
it has all the above unfortunate propensities in a much less
degree, and is not without some share of small shrewdness
and fox-like common sense; on which, however, it is apt
to presume, and is, therefore, a more impudent Nose than
the Snub.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>The following subordinate rules are applicable to all
kinds of Noses, and must be attended to before forming a
judgment on any Nose.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. The Power of a Nose depends upon its length in
proportion to the profile. A Nose should not be less than
one-third of the entire length of the profile, from the root
of the hair to the tip of the chin.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. The character of a Nose is weakened in intensity by
forming too great, or too small an angle with the general
profile of the face. This angle, if as great as 40°, is not
good, anything beyond that is bad; about 30° is best.
Angles: <img src='images/i_p012a.jpg' alt='45°.' class='h12a' />
<img src='images/i_p012b.jpg' alt='40°.' class='h12a' />
<img src='images/i_p012c.jpg' alt='30°.' class='h12a' />
—less than
<img src='images/i_p012d.jpg' alt='25°.' class='h12a' />
becomes a snub.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. Attention should be paid to the angle which the
basal line of the Nose forms with the upper lip. This
angle affects intensity, and also temperament. If it is an
obtuse angle, as thus
<img src='images/i_p012e.jpg' alt='' class='h12b' />,
the consequent abbreviation
of the Nose (for a long Nose has always more Power
than a short one) weakens the character, but the temperament
is cheerful, gay, and lively; if on the other hand the
angle is acute, as thus
<img src='images/i_p012f.jpg' alt='' class='h12b' />,
the elongation of the
Nose adds much to the intensity of the character indicated
by the profile; but the disposition is generally melancholy,
and, if a very acute angle, desponding and fond of
gloomy thoughts. Fox (the Martyrologist), John Knox,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>Calvin, George Herbert, Edmund Spenser, and Dante, are
illustrations of the melancholy Nose.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER II.<br /> <span class='large'>OF THE ROMAN NOSE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Class I.</span>—<span class='sc'>The Roman</span>, or Aquiline Nose, is rather convex, but
undulating, as its name aquiline imports. It is usually rugose
and coarse; but when otherwise it approaches the Greek Nose, and
the character is materially altered.</p>

<p class='c017'>It indicates great Decision, considerable Energy, Firmness, Absence
of refinement, and Disregard for the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bienséances</span></i> of life.</p>

<p class='c006'>Numerous portraits, both in marble and on coins,
demonstrate that this Nose was very frequent among the
Romans, and peculiarly characteristic of that nation.
Hence its name. The persevering energy, stern determination,
and unflinching firmness of the conquerors of the
world; their rough, unrefined character, which, notwithstanding
the example of Greece, never acquired the polish
of that country, all indicate the accuracy of the mental habit
attributed to the owner of this Nose.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sufficient stress has never been laid by historians on
national characteristics. The peculiar psychonomy of
nations is an element which is never taken into account,
when the historical critic endeavours to elucidate the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>causes and consequences of events. He judges of all
nations by the standard of his own, regardless of age,
climate, physiognomy, and psychonomy. This is as
absurd as the fashion the Greeks had of deducing foreign
names and titles from the Greek, a practice which Cicero
wittily ridicules. In this ridicule we willingly join; yet
we are equally open to it, when we interpret the actions of
foreign nations by our own national standard.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was the psychonomic difference between the Romans
and the Greeks, which prevented the former from benefiting
so efficiently from the lessons in art and philosophy of the
latter, as they would have done had their minds been
congenial.</p>

<p class='c007'>The refinement which Rome received from Greece, was
converted in the transfer into a refinement of coarse
sensual luxury. Rome, after the conquest of Greece, filled
its forums and halls with Greek workmanship, and its
schools with Greek learning; nevertheless Roman mind
advanced not one step beyond its original coarseness.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the period when Rome possessed itself by conquest
of the principal works of Grecian art, her citizens only
regarded them as household furniture of but little value.
Polybius narrates that, after the siege of Corinth, he saw
some Roman soldiers playing at dice upon a picture of
Bacchus, by Aristides; a picture esteemed one of the
finest in the world. When King Attalus offered 600,000
sesterces (£4,845 15<em>s.</em>) for this picture, Mummius, the
Roman Consul, thinking there must be some magic property
in it, to make it worth such an enormous sum,
refused to sell it, and hung it up in the Temple of Ceres
at Rome. So little were the Romans conscious of the real
value of the treasures of Greek art, that Mummius covenanted
with the masters of the ships, hired to convey the
spoils of Corinth to Rome, that if any of the exquisite
paintings and statuary should be lost, <em>they should replace
them with new ones</em>!<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c012'><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It is not surprising, therefore, that Rome, although
possessed of infinitely greater wealth, a larger population,
and the splendid examples of Greece, not only produced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>no artist of merit, but receded far from the high standard
which Greece, notwithstanding its internal divisions, its
comparative poverty, small extent, and unassisted genius,
had established. There is no way of accounting for these
facts, but by the difference in their psychonomy. The
genius of Rome was of a very different nature from that of
Greece, and was incompetent to advance the great work
which the latter had commenced.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is an example which, with numerous others that
occur in the world’s history, might teach those who, in
modern phrase, assert that the uniform order of the world is
<em>progress</em>, that retrogression has ofttimes been the apparent
order, and that it is a foolish short-sightedness to judge of
the order of the world from a few hundred years in its
history. The Greek who remembered the magnificent
works of his country, and looked upon the degenerate
splendor of Rome, no doubt equally dogmatically asserted
that the world was in its dotage, that it had retrograded,
and would never be regenerated.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ancient Hindoo, who, in ages too remote for history
to record, wept over the fallen splendor and lost power,
the ruined wealth and degenerate arts of his country;
the Egyptian who, in ante-Mosaic periods, beheld the
fierce and barbarous Shepherd-Kings trampling with
haughty contempt and hostile fanaticism on the wonderful
works which still astonish the <em>progressed</em> world; the
Assyrian, who, a century before the foundation of Rome,
witnessed the downfall of his country’s magnificence and
extensive empire,—all equally thought that these glories
would never be resuscitated, and that the best ages of the
world were past away; and if any of them had been told,
that in other lands and other climes they would, in far-distant
ages, be outvied, he would have turned with
incredulity from the prospect, and have demanded what
race was to surpass the glorious achievements of his own.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the modern dogmatist tries to take his case out of
the argument, by pretending that Christianity will protect
the world from again retrograding. This is the mere
pride of the Pharisee, who flatters himself that he is not
as other men are, that his Christianity is too pure to fall,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>and his knowledge too vast to be blasted. Or else he
forgets that the pure Christianity of the first disciples and
martyrs failed to preserve succeeding generations from
the inroads of sin and darkness more overwhelming than
had ever blackened the face of Europe since the commencement
of the historical period. The dogmatist of those days
sighed over the world’s degeneracy, and saw not through
the surrounding gloom any hopeful gleam of light; just as
the modern dogmatist rejoices over the world’s advance,
without perceiving any overhanging shadow of darkness.</p>

<p class='c007'>Both judge of the world by their own time and circumstances,
just as we are too apt to judge of each other by
ourselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>A due regard to the psychonomy of nations would throw
much light upon many abstruse points of history, and
often serve to corroborate narrations which appear marvellous
and incredible to us. Thus, as we have, for the most
part,<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c012'><sup>[9]</sup></a> left off eating human flesh in these islands for some
thousand years or more, historians reject as utterly incredible
that our forefathers were cannibals; and some still
more tender-hearted philanthropists even venture to assert
that cannibalism has not and never had an existence anywhere.
Whereas, if they would compare the evidence
with the psychonomy of the nations of whom the circumstance
is narrated, instead of with our own, they would
instantly perceive in it nothing unnatural nor incredible.
Thus also infidel writers, unable to comprehend the fervent
and assured hope of a blessed immortality which supported
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>the martyrs, deny, as repugnant to human nature, the
patient sufferings of the early Christians. And thus
again commentators on the Bible, both infidel and credent,
have made sad havoc of many texts, by endeavoring to
interpret them by European manners and habits. This
inattention to national psychonomy is, moreover, a fertile
cause of the mal-administration of colonies, and was the
root of nine-tenths of the errors in Indian affairs during
the last century.</p>

<p class='c007'>Seeing, then, the importance of fully understanding the
psychonomy of nations before criticizing their records, we
should reject no probable key to that requisite knowledge;
and if physiognomy would furnish such a key, it should be
hailed as an important element in historical criticism. This
consideration has induced us to complete our system by a
few remarks on National Noses. For no part of the physiognomy
is more needful to be comprehended than the
Nose, if Nasology be correct; because the mental faculties
which it pourtrays are more important than those revealed
in the other features; and because, being immovable and
permanent in its outline, the artist gives us its national or
individual form, without the distortion which the action
or passion exhibited may make it necessary to throw over
the other more pliant features.</p>

<p class='c007'>Reserving, then, till a future chapter, any further observations
on National Noses, we will now consider a few
individual instances of the Roman Nose.</p>

<p class='c007'>This Nose is common to all great conquerors and warriors,
and other persons who have exhibited vast energy
and perseverance in overcoming great obstacles without
regard to personal ease, or the welfare of their fellow-men.</p>

<p class='c006'>The following have pure, or very nearly pure, Roman
Noses:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>

      <div class='line'>Rameses II (Sesostris).</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The well-known, because (as their Noses likewise attest)
strongly marked, characters of these persons render it
unnecessary to allude even briefly to their biographies.
Their names are sufficient to bring at once before the mind
their energetic, persevering, and determined characters.
They were persons whom no hardships could deter, no
fears daunt, no affections turn aside from any purpose
which they had undertaken: that purpose being (from the
absence of the Cogitative) always of a physical character;
and (from the absence of the Greek) always pursued with
a stern and reckless disregard of their own and others’
physical ease and welfare. Their successes were attained
by energy and perseverance, not by forethought and deep
scheming. They were not the men of the closet, but of
the field. Physical action, not mental activity, was their
adopted road to success. For this reason, and because
history is little more than a chronicle of physical action,
wars and bloodshed, the owners of Roman Noses occupy
the largest portion of their fellow-men’s thoughts and of
the historical page.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ancients acknowledged the foregoing Nasal Classification,
for they represented Jupiter, Hercules, Minerva,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>Bellatrix, and other energetic Deities with Roman Noses,
which Plato designates, from its being indicative of
Power and Energy, ‘the Royal Nose,’—while they gave
pure Greek Noses to the more refined Apollo, Bacchus,
Juno, Venus, &amp;c. The debased and unintellectual Fawn
and Satyr they pourtrayed with Snub or Celestial Noses;
thus imparting to their countenances the low cunning or
bestial inanity appropriate to those mythological inventions.</p>

<p class='c007'>It must not, however, be inferred from the majority of
warriors’ names in the above list, that the Roman Nose
necessarily indicates a warrior.</p>

<p class='c007'>These names are only selected because they afford well-known
and easily verifiable instances, requiring neither
pictorial nor biographical illustration. Energy may be
equally conspicuous in any other department of life, and
display itself as fully in the civilian as in the warrior.
Two of the individuals adduced are striking instances of
this:—Cato the Censor, and the Earl of Chatham. They
were men of remarkable parallelism of character, and,
though differing in other facial features, their Noses were
very similar.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>

<div class='ic004'>
<p>CATO THE CENSOR.<br /><br />(<em>From a gem in the Florentine Museum.</em>)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The events of their early life—those events which
always bear most clearly the impress of the mind, because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>actuated by choice, and not by present or future consequences—were
almost identical. They both entered
the army in youth, and both quitted it for the Senate.
Here each displayed those powers of eloquence which
raised them to the highest eminence, and will transmit
their names to the latest posterity. Its peculiar feature
was that energetic, powerful, and determined vehemence
of language, which takes the mind prisoner, and carries
the judgment with it by storm. It was irresistible. Before
it all minds of less power, though of greater intellect and
activity, recoiled. The orations of Cato are unhappily
lost. But Cicero, a master of eloquence, and well enabled
to compare them with similar compositions, passes upon
them the highest eulogiums. The eloquence of Cato has
been compared, for its force and energy, to the eloquence
of that Demosthenes before whom Philip of Macedon
quailed, and whose tremendous orations have given the
name of Philippics to all sarcastic and vehement invectives.
Of Chatham’s eloquence, it has been said by Wilkes:
“Nothing could withstand the force of that contagion. The
fluent Murray has faltered, and even Fox shrunk back
appalled from an adversary ‘fraught with fire unquenchable,’
if I may borrow the expression of our great Milton.
He had not the correctness of language so striking in the
great Roman orator; but he had the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">verba ardentia</span></i>, the
bold, glowing words.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Cato led victorious armies into the field, and proved
himself an able general; for in Rome the functions of the
general and the statesman were united in the person of the
Consul.</p>

<p class='c007'>It became not, however, the Secretary of State to lead
armies in person; but while Chatham administered the
affairs of this country, “victory crowned the British arms
wherever they appeared, both on sea and land; and the
four years of the second administration of Mr. Pitt are
four of the most glorious years in the history of the
eighteenth century.”<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c012'><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In their retirement they were alike; for neither regarded
with complacency the pursuits of literature: they required
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>some physical activity in their very idleness, and gardening
was the favourite occupation of both. Cato displayed his
disregard and even hatred for literary refinement by advising
the Senate to dismiss the Grecian Ambassador Carneades
promptly, lest his eloquence should corrupt the Roman
youth with a love for Greek learning and philosophy.</p>

<p class='c007'>He cultivated his farm and garden with great skill, and
wrote a work on the subject, entitled “<cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Rustica</span></cite>.”
Chatham was a landscape-gardener of no mean pretensions.
He assisted Lord Lyttelton in laying out the celebrated
park and grounds at Hagley; and Bishop Warburton
eulogizes his skill in gardening as inimitable, and far superior
to that of the professor Capability Brown. Not even
obedience to the king’s mandate could draw Chatham
from his country retirement at Hayes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Neither ever thought he had done serving his country
while life lasted, even when bodily health and strength
were gone. At eighty-four years of age Cato went on an
embassy to Carthage; and Chatham, worn out by the gout
and wrapped in flannels, never neglected to take his seat
in the House and electrify it with his eloquence when any
important question affecting the interests of the country or
the liberty of the subject arose.</p>

<p class='c007'>Notwithstanding their many virtues, they were both
coarse-minded, violent men; proud, self-willed, and
regardless of the common courtesies, and even decencies,
of society. Both were perhaps indebted for some of
their fame to the successful practice of the vice which
has been happily designated as the deference paid to
virtue.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not, therefore, only in the peculiar circumstances
of his death, that Chatham resembles Cato, with whom
he has therein been frequently compared.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will be remembered that after Cato’s return from
Carthage (the inveterate enemy and most powerful rival
of Rome), Cato, then in the eighty-fifth year of his age,
and the last year of his life, never spoke in the Senate
without expressing his conviction of the dangerous power
of Carthage, and concluding with the celebrated words
“<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Delenda est Carthago</span></i>.” Chatham, when peace with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>America was proposed on terms which he thought dishonourable
to his country, expended his last strength
in opposing it, and fell, to survive but a few days,
senseless on the floor of the House of Lords.</p>

<p class='c007'>Those who attribute to the founder of the Jesuits the
characteristics of that powerful Order, both over-estimate
and calumniate the man, <span class='sc'>Ignatius Loyola</span>. He foresaw
none of the power and eminence which his successors
would attain; he contemplated neither their conquests,
their influence, wealth, nor extensive domination.</p>

<p class='c007'>The wounded soldier on his miserable pallet devising conquests
over Satan, composing his <cite>Spiritual Exercises</cite>, and
framing his celebrated <cite>Constitutions</cite>, contemplated for himself
and his followers a scene of action wholly different from
that into which they were finally—accidentally or Providentially,
who shall say?—determined. His ambition contemplated
no worldly fame; he sought not riches nor the
applause of men. He proposed only to carry the Christian
warfare into the country of the infidel, and in poverty and
“perfect obedience to the Holy See” to rescue souls from
perdition. The original object of his Order was the noble
one of preaching the Gospel among the Mahometans,
especially in the Holy Land; and for this specific object,
his <cite>Spiritual Exercises</cite> and his <cite>Constitutions</cite> were composed,
and his Order founded. It was for this purpose
that the Pope sanctioned the formation of the Society, and
its members were on the point of departure for Asia when
war broke out between the Turks and the Christians.</p>

<p class='c007'>This unexpected event rendered their journey physically
impossible, and compelled the newly-sworn aspirants to
fulfil their vows of perfect obedience in some other direction,
to be enjoined by the Head of the Church. Thenceforth
they remained in Europe, where the Reformation
afforded ample scope for their exertions, and where they
only too successfully combated with the new heresy
instead of with the old apostacy. The mind of Ignatius
Loyola was swayed by none of the characteristics of
Jesuitism. His character was open, direct, fearless.
Physically active and wonderfully energetic, to conceive
was to determine; to determine was to act.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>When his broken leg was set awry he only said, “Break
it again and set it straight;” still the bone protruded and
threatened to spoil the shape of his boot: “Cut off the
projection and stretch the limb in an iron jack,” was a
command which showed the unflinching determination of
the man.</p>

<p class='c007'>Confined to his bed, the “Lives of the Saints” is brought
to him for his amusement. He is struck with their sufferings
for the faith, and, on the instant, determines to do
likewise. Thenceforth his whole soul has but one ambition,
to suffer for the faith; and this ambition actuated
the remainder of his life. To run through the life of
Ignatius, to pourtray his fearful sufferings; his degrading
servitude in misery, in beggary, and rags; his unwearying
perseverance in acquiring a knowledge of language and
divinity; his journeyings; his rebuffs; his trials; his
successes—would be to exhibit what can be effected by
mere perseverance and physical energy, without the gift of
great mental powers.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the peculiarly remarkable physical bias of Ignatius’s
mind is still more strikingly developed in his writings.
Other men have been equally active and persevering—other
men have equalled him in mere bodily activity and
suffering; but to Ignatius alone belongs the discovery of
exercising the mind by converting his thoughts into actual
realities, and rendering the creations of the imagination
true existences.</p>

<p class='c007'>Herein appears the peculiarly physical tone of his mind,
which could not rest content with mere spiritual contemplation,
but must actually, as it were, see, feel, smell,
taste, and hear the objects contemplated. The <cite>Spiritual
Exercises</cite> enjoin that the exercitant must, in his gloomiest
hours, not only think upon, but actually <em>behold</em>, the vast
conflagration of Hell; he must <em>hear</em> its wailings, shrieks,
and blasphemies; he must <em>smell</em> its smoky brimstone,
and the horrid stench of its filth and rottenness; he must
<em>taste</em> the saltness of the tears of penitence, and the bitterness
of the rancour of the heart, and the loathsomeness of
the worm of conscience; and he must <em>touch</em> the very fire
by which the souls of the reprobate are scorched. Thus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>each meditation must be, not mere thinking-on, or contemplation,
but must be instinct with life—must be continued
until the senses seem actually to see, taste, and feel
the objects contemplated.</p>

<p class='c007'>So, in contemplating the passion of our Lord, the horrors
of his death must be visibly present; we must <em>hear</em> his
last words; we must <em>listen</em> to the shoutings of the populace;
we must <em>watch</em> the agony of the virgin-mother beholding
the infamy of her blessed son; we must <em>see</em> his
quivering limbs, his death-like paleness, his tottering weakness
under the burden of the cross, his bleeding side and
pierced extremities. Merely to see these things in contemplation
is trivial and inessential; we must, with certain
interior senses, actually see, hear, taste, and smell, not
only the personages and scenes on which the mind is
dwelling, but the emotions which the scenes are calculated
to excite. So again, we must taste and relish the suavity
and lusciousness of the pious soul, and by a like internal
sense of touch we must actually feel and kiss the very
garments, places, and footsteps of the personages whose
acts our minds dwell upon.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is justly called “the application of the senses” to
the soul.</p>

<p class='c007'>It consists, in fact, in reducing to <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quasi</span></i>-materialisms
the visions of the mind; in giving to the exercitant’s
thoughts, every reality short of such an actual-material
existence as would render them visible to others—as they
are, indeed, visible to himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this remarkable system for exciting the soul appears
the utter incapacity of the mind of Ignatius to appreciate
mere metaphysical activity. His soul could not apprehend
the unseen, and dwell on the absent or far distant. It was
necessary to his frame of mind that everything should be
present, visible, tangible, real.</p>

<p class='c007'>The soul of the founder of the Jesuits was, therefore,
strikingly accordant with the revelation of his physiognomy;
although, were it true, that he was—in the vulgar sense—a
Jesuit, the Greek Nose and generally a more delicate
caste of countenance, would more correctly have pourtrayed
his inner man.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>But the founder of the Jesuits was no Jesuit, and had
his original <cite>Constitutions</cite> been adhered to, the Order would
never have achieved the bad eminence which it so rapidly
attained, so long held, so quickly lost, and so tenaciously
still aspires after.</p>

<p class='c006'>As by far the majority of persons have compound Noses,
and as their consideration will therefore throw additional
light upon the system, we shall add a few observations
upon some of them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Roman Nose may be compounded with Classes II
and III, rarely with IV; seldom or never with V and VI.<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c012'><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Compound <span class='fraction'>I<br /><span class='vincula'>II</span></span>,—the Romano-Greek Nose.<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c012'><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The following are instances of Noses of this sub-class:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Alexander the Great.</div>
      <div class='line'>Constantine.</div>
      <div class='line'>Wolsey.</div>
      <div class='line'>Richelieu.</div>
      <div class='line'>Ximenes.</div>

      <div class='line'>Sir P. Sidney.</div>
      <div class='line'>Napoleon.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Associated with much physical energy (I), these persons
all exhibited much refinement of mind, a love for Arts
and Letters, considerable astuteness and capacity of
scheming; (II) they saw far and quickly, though deficient
in deep philosophical powers of thought.</p>

<p class='c007'>A rather more extended notice of some of the members
of the sub-classes will be requisite; as, of course, their
characters were less developed, and therefore less known,
than those of the pure classes; but principally in order
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>to point out the more minute touches, and, apparently,
inconsistencies of character which illustrate the compound
form of Nose.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>

<div class='ic004'>
<p>CONSTANTINE.<br /><br />(<em>From a gem in the Florentine Museum.</em>)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Constantine</span>, having by a felicitous union of enterprise
and cunning procured his elevation to the Imperial throne,
and having defeated the last of his rivals to that splendid
dignity, directed his attention to the concentration rather
than the extension of his enormous empire, and sought,
by building Constantinople, to divert the minds of the
people from foreign war and intestine discord; while
he at the same time fostered and encouraged the arts by
the magnificent decoration of the new capital, to which he
brought from Asia and Greece some of their most splendid
productions.</p>

<p class='c007'>Vigorous in war and active in peace, Constantine united
all the characteristics of the Roman and the Greek. In
war he successfully opposed both civil and foreign enemies,
and made himself master of the most extended empire
Rome had ever designated by her name. While in the
vigour of his age, he moved with slow dignity, or with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>active vigilance, according to the various exigencies of
peace and war, along the frontiers of his extensive
dominions, and was always prepared to take the field
either against a foreign or a domestic enemy.</p>

<p class='c007'>But when he had gradually reached the summit of
prosperity and the decline of life, he became sensible of
the ambition of founding a city which might perpetuate
the glory of his name, and he then exhibited all the
capacities for the enjoyment of the luxuries of peace which
had hitherto lain dormant in his mind. The mere building
and fortifying a city, which would have satisfied the
ambition of the coarser-minded Roman, was not his
ambition only. He desired to decorate it with the highest
efforts of human genius, and make it not only a monument
of his military prowess, but also of his taste and refinement.
For this purpose he founded schools of architecture to
supply the disparity which his fine taste detected between
the degenerate artists of his time and those of early Greece.
The immortal productions of Phidias and Lysippus were
dragged from other countries to adorn his capital; and,
unmindful of the injustice, he despoiled the cities of Greece
and Asia of their most valuable ornaments. The trophies
of memorable wars, the objects of religious veneration,
the most finished statues of the gods and heroes, of the
sages and poets of ancient times, contributed to the
splendid triumph of Constantinople.<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c012'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The character of <span class='sc'>Wolsey</span> was very similar to that of
Constantine. We might almost venture to assert that
had he been placed in the same situation he would have
pursued the same course. Yet the only part of their
physiognomies which assimilates are their Noses. One
remarkable circumstance in the early life of each identifies
the two men, and exhibits in them the union of energy
with acute tact. Constantine, half assured of his elevation
to the Imperial throne, if he could join his father’s army
and be present with him in case of his death, and having
with difficulty obtained permission to visit his father from
Galerius, (who dreaded the same event, and delayed the
permission, until he believed it would be impossible for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>him to accomplish his object), travelled post through
Bithynia, Dacia, Thracia, Pannonia, Italy and Gaul, with
such speed that he reached Boulogne in the very moment
when his father was preparing to embark for Britain,
accompanied him, and finally, by military election, succeeded
to his share of the Empire.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Henry VII was looking out in his old age for a
rich wife, he despatched Wolsey, to whom the vista of
future eminence was just opening, to Flanders, to treat for
the hand of a Princess of the Empire. Wolsey, conscious
that in such affairs old age brooks no delay, started on his
journey and had returned before the King knew that he
was gone. By similar energy and shrewd scheming in pursuit
of his own aggrandizement, very analogous to that by
which Constantine secured the purple, Wolsey elevated himself
to the highest subordinate station in his country, and
then directed his mind rather to the extension of learning,
the encouragement of art, the erection of splendid buildings,
and the increase of domestic magnificence, than to an
imitation of the warlike pursuits of the ancestors of his
monarch; although the disposition of the latter strongly
tended in that more physically energetic direction. The
noble hall and chapel at Hampton Court and the remains
of the colleges which Wolsey founded, still attest his
magnificence, his taste, his liberality, and his respect for
learning.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Richelieu</span> was another Wolsey. It is a remarkable
fact that the point of identity in actively seeking their
own aggrandizement, which has been noticed between
Wolsey and Constantine, occurs also in the early life of
Richelieu. Having, from interested motives, abandoned
the army (for which he was originally destined) for the
Church, and the Pope having refused, on account of his
extreme youth, to sanction his elevation to the Bishopric
for the sake of which he had taken orders, he resolved
to overcome this difficulty in person; and setting off for
Rome, gave the Pontiff such convincing proofs of his
talents, that he was consecrated Bishop forthwith, at
twenty-two years of age, and thus laid the foundation of
his future eminence.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>He conducted in person the siege of Rochelle, and
baffled the finest military geniuses of Europe; he out-intrigued
the ablest diplomatists; he nourished arts and
commerce, and for the better promotion of learning he
founded the French Academy.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the union of energy of character and refinement of
tastes the three celebrated Cardinal-ministers of England,
France, and Spain, strongly assimilated.</p>

<p class='c007'>The anecdotes which have been related of the energetic
carving-out of their own fortunes by Constantine, Wolsey,
and Richelieu, find also their parallel in the early career
of <span class='sc'>Ximenes</span>. The son of noble parents, but without
wealth or patronage, he had nothing but his talents and
the energy of his character to carry him successfully
through life. He began as a student at Salamanca; but
finding that sphere too limited for his ambition, he undertook
a journey to Rome, where he soon distinguished himself
as an advocate, but preferring the church, took holy
orders.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sixtus IV had bestowed upon him the reversionary
grant of the first benefice which should fall vacant in
Spain. This proved to be Uceda; and, on the demise of
the incumbent, he produced his letters, and took possession
with such promptitude and despatch that he baffled the
Archbishop of Toledo, who considered the benefice to be
in his gift, and had promised it to one of his dependents.</p>

<p class='c007'>Like Richelieu he took the field in person, and in spite
of the jealousy of the King, the dissensions of the generals,
and the mutiny of the soldiers, he succeeded in taking the
town of Oran on the coast of Barbary; the first success of
any moment which the Spanish army could boast in a
campaign of four years’ duration.</p>

<p class='c007'>He devoted himself, in after-life, to the encouragement
of popular education and the advancement of higher learning
in no less degree than his brother Cardinals before named.
He founded a school for the education of the daughters of
the poorer nobility, and subsequently provided them with
marriage-portions.</p>

<p class='c007'>He established the University of Alcala, richly endowed
it, and filled its professorial chairs with the most distinguished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>learned men of Europe. Here he undertook the
magnificent work, known as the Complutensian Bible. It
was the first Polyglott Bible ever published, and as such
affords a striking contrast to the otherwise undeviating
opposition which Spain has offered to the spread of true
Christianity and the circulation of the Scriptures.</p>

<p class='c007'>It should, however, be remembered that even this was
a sealed book to the laity, since it did not comprise a
version in the vernacular. It contained the Old Testament
in the Hebrew, the Septuagint, the Vulgate of St. Jerome,
and the Chaldee Paraphrase with Latin translations, and
the New Testament in the Greek and Vulgate.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was the work of fifteen years, and when the last
volume was brought to Ximenes, shortly before his death,
he exclaimed: “Many high and difficult matters have I
carried on for the state, yet is there nothing which I have
done, that deserves higher congratulations than this edition
of the Scriptures—the fountain-head of our holy religion,
whence may flow purer streams of theology than those
which have been turned off from it.” The whole cost of
the work, fifty thousand gold crowns, was defrayed by
Ximenes.</p>

<p class='c007'>In <span class='sc'>Lorenzo de’ Medici</span> we meet with another of those
characters, frequent among men eminent in public affairs,
which unite refinement of taste with physical energy. To
live in the world’s eye with success, it is necessary to
exhibit something <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad captandum vulgus</span></i>. There must either
be the intense energy of the Roman, or the more moderate
energy with the taste and magnificence of the Romano-Greek.
Hence, while the former class of Nose prevails
among those who have won fame and honours by arms
merely, the latter is frequent among those who are chiefly
celebrated for their statesmanship. But both energy and
statesmanship were necessary to him who would secure a
world’s fame as ruler of a petty Italian state. The head
of a state too weak to be feared in war, and too turbulent
to be governed in calm tranquillity, required some other
qualities beside energy, in order to be respected and
honoured by his contemporaries. These qualities were
happily united in Lorenzo de’ Medici. Firm in danger,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>prompt in action, lavish in expenditure, refined in taste,
accomplished in learning, expert in art, he was every way
formed to win laurels in an age which boasted the greatest
statesmen, the best artists, and the most profound scholars.
The vigour and promptitude with which he repelled the
celebrated conspiracy of the Pazzi family, hanged an Archbishop
on the spot in full canonicals, and punished the
conspirators, alone attest his energy. The title of Magnificent,
which he earned in an age celebrated for its magnificence,
demonstrates his lavish liberality; while his love
for antiquities, his patronage of the arts of sculpture and
painting, his studious devotion to learning and the writings
of the ancients, bespeak the refinement of his mind.
Among other institutions he founded a school for the
study of antiquities, and furnished it with the finest
specimens of ancient workmanship. “To this institution,
more than to any other circumstance, we may, without
any hesitation, ascribe the sudden and astonishing proficiency,
which, towards the close of the fifteenth century,
was evidently made in the arts, and which, commencing at
Florence, extended itself to the rest of Europe.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘It is highly deserving of notice,’ says Vasari, ‘that
all those who studied in the gardens of the Medici, and
were favoured by Lorenzo, became most excellent artists,
which can only be attributed to the exquisite judgment of
this great patron of their studies.’”<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c012'><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Frederick</span> II is another example of the union of
refined tastes with vigorous energy. It is not so much for
his military genius that he is to be remembered and
respected, as for the impulse he gave to Prussian intellect,
and thence generally to German mind.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is true this was hardly perceptible till the present
century, for until the peace of 1815, Germany had been
the seat of almost incessant warfare, and was, therefore,
disabled from pursuing the arts of peace with success.
But thirty years’ peace has enabled her to perform great
things, and to justify a pretty sure hope of yet greater.
We ought to be far in advance of her, for where she now
is we were exactly two hundred and fifty years and upwards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>ago. Till the reign of Elizabeth, England had been,
like Germany till 1815, the seat of perpetual war or religious
discord. At the end of the sixteenth century in
England, and at the beginning of the nineteenth in Germany,
the Teutonic mind began to develope itself with
effect. The same deep investigations in history, the same
subtle disquisitions in metaphysics, the same love of philological
criticism that distinguished English literature in
the early part of the seventeenth century, belong to German
literature in the nineteenth, and are combined with
the same coarseness of manners that marked our ancestors.
The Germans still delight in those rude, indecent productions,
called Miracle-plays or Mysteries,<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c012'><sup>[15]</sup></a> which amused
the predecessors of Shakspere: a written character, ugly,
uncouth, and elsewhere obsolete; the recent adoption of
the vernacular in literary composition;<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c012'><sup>[16]</sup></a> legalized wager
of battle; semi-feudalism; masques of fools dancing in a
gigantic beer-barrel and chanting the praises of beer;
deer-battues; perpetual duelling and beer-swigging; feasts
of horse-flesh; millions pilgrimaging to the Coat of Treves;
the implicit reception of sham miracles, all mark a state
of society little removed from that magnificent barbarism
which stained the rush-strewn court of the ear-boxing
and swearing Elizabeth.</p>

<p class='c007'>In refinement, and that wealth which springs from
Science, we have advanced far beyond Germany; but in
that wealth which emanates from Mind we are only on a
par with her. The causes of this will be considered more
fully hereafter, when we treat, under Class III, of the
causes of the decline of Wisdom.</p>

<p class='c007'>The impulse given to German Mind may in a great
measure be attributed to the pains which Frederick II
took to civilise and educate his people. For this purpose
he founded numerous popular schools, it is said as many
as sixty in one year. He instituted an Academy of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>Sciences and fostered Universities. He patronized Commerce
and the Arts, and by his wise administration as
much as by his military talents raised Prussia to the rank
of a second-rate European State. The military success of
the correspondent of Voltaire, it is unnecessary to do more
than refer to.</p>

<p class='c007'>Machiavellism formed a strikingly distinctive feature in
the characters of all the foregoing personages. They all
possessed more of the wisdom of the serpent, than of the
innocence of the dove. It may be thought, however, that
we employ too strong a term in calling this Machiavellism.
A less strict morality would only call it policy, worldly
wisdom. In men of strong conscientiousness, astuteness
may be little or nothing more; but where the moral sense
is weak, it easily passes into duplicity and dishonest craft.</p>

<p class='c007'>The shrewd policy and worldly wisdom by which the
great <span class='sc'>Alfred</span> civilized a barbarous people, and tamed to
quietude a nation of turbulent robbers, has never been
accused of departing from a strict morality. It may be
that he is somewhat indebted to the partiality of the
monkish historians for the very flattering pictures of him
handed down to us. The prompt and energetic manner
in which, from time to time, he fell upon and defeated the
Danes who ravaged the country is too well known to need
mention, and the prudent means by which he endeavoured
to incite his people to educate themselves has been often
the subject of praise. In a remarkably illiterate age, he
alone courted literature, and, conscious of its power to
civilize his people, urged them to follow his example.
Nevertheless, he did not forget the more arduous duties of
a King. While devoting a large part of his time to
learning, he never neglected the interests of his country;
nor suffered her liberties to be trampled upon by invaders
while he was cultivating the arts of peace. His biographer,
quaintly and somewhat poetically, describes the
King’s studious mind and gubernatorial talents. “Like a
most productive bee, he flew here and there asking questions
as he went, until he had eagerly and unceasingly
collected many various flowers of Divine Scripture, with
which he thickly stored the cells of his mind. His
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>friends would voluntarily sustain little or no toil, though
it was for the common necessity of the kingdom; but he
alone, sustained by the divine aid, like a skilful pilot,
strove to steer his ship laden with much wealth, into the
safe and much-desired harbour of his country though
almost all his crew were tired, and suffered them not to
faint or hesitate, though sailing among the manifold waves
and eddies of this present life.”<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c012'><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The circumstances in which men are involuntarily placed
marvellously affect their actions. Crowd together a
number of young trees in one small plot, and how slowly
they grow, how stunted they become! Remove them to
separate stations, where their roots may spread, their
branches expand, and their leaves drink freely of the sun
and air, and how soon they take their place among the
giants of the forest. So it is with men. Crowded in cities,
undistinguished by birth, and unassisted by patronage,
many a hero dies unseen and unnoticed—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Some village Hampden, that with dauntless breast,</div>
      <div class='line'>The little tyrant of his fields withstood;</div>
      <div class='line'>Some mute inglorious Milton here may rest,</div>
      <div class='line'>Some Cromwell, guiltless of his country’s blood.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Let it not, therefore, be imagined, from the foregoing
instances, that every Greco-Roman Nose indicates an
energetic statesman, or a literary monarch; or that the
same actions are to be predicated from the same form of
Nose in different men under different circumstances.</p>

<p class='c007'>Energy and refinement may exist in every department
of life. The peasant may furnish as illustrious an example
of either as the Prince. But what a King has, these
heroes want; and so they die unhonoured for lack of a
record. The illustrations are, therefore, necessarily drawn
from the high and mighty of various spheres.</p>

<p class='c007'>Stars of lesser magnitude, however, present themselves
to shed a further light upon the subject.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Sir Walter Raleigh</span> and <span class='sc'>Sir Philip Sidney</span>
were two men whose characters exhibited many points
of identity.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>In any arduous enterprize which promised fame and
honour, Sir Walter Raleigh was always prominent.
Eager to support the Reformation, he served in the
Protestant army as a volunteer during the civil wars in
France, and afterwards tendered his services to the
Netherlands in their contest with Spain for civil and
religious liberty. One of the most attractive enterprizes
of the reign of Elizabeth to men of energy and forethought
was, however, that presented by the recently-opened
field of American discovery. Into this Raleigh
threw himself heart and soul. With his half-brother,
Sir Humphrey Gilbert, he made the then perilous voyage
to the New World, but failed to establish a firm footing
on its shores.</p>

<p class='c007'>Still he was not to be thus foiled. After a careful consideration
of the best authorities, he came to the just
conclusion that there was land north of the Gulf of Florida,
a tract then wholly unexplored. Having obtained
from the Queen the inexpensive grant of all he might
discover, be it sea or be it land, be it inhabited or be it
void, he fitted out vessels of discovery; and, though not
permitted by the wary Queen to accompany them himself,
they verified his predictions by discovering the country
now called Virginia—a name which the virgin Queen
herself bestowed upon it.</p>

<p class='c007'>But it was not by his energy that Raleigh alone distinguished
himself. The young Protestant volunteer, and
the American adventurer would long since have been
forgotten among a host of compeers, had not he presented
far higher claims to the notice of posterity. “Raleigh
was one of those rare men who seem qualified to excel
in all pursuits alike; and his talents were set off by
an extraordinary <em>laboriousness</em>, and <em>capacity</em> of application.
(<span class='fraction'>I<br /><span class='vincula'>II</span></span>). As a navigator, soldier, statesman, and historian, his
name is intimately and honourably linked with one of the
most brilliant periods of British history.”<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c012'><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Sir Walter Raleigh occupies a distinguished place in
literature, both as a poet and an historian. It is probable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>that only a small portion of his poetry has come down to
us. He seems to have regarded it but lightly himself,
and many very beautiful pieces, which there is no reason
to doubt owe their origin to his creative brain, are without
name, and only preserved in some obscure miscellaneous
collections, under the modest signature ‘Ignoto.’
One of these, sometimes entitled “The Lie,” and sometimes
“The Soul’s Errand,” is as beautiful, as Christian,
and as philosophic a poem as any in the language; yet so
little pains did he take to secure to himself the literary
fame of the words with which he had relieved his labouring
soul, that it has been attributed to divers poetasters,
and, among others, to that most wretched inharmonious
scribe, Joshua Sylvester.</p>

<p class='c007'>Spenser eulogizes Raleigh’s poetic powers as those of
one</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“... as skilful in that art as any.”<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c012'><sup>[19]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>He likewise entitles him ‘the summer’s nightingale,’ and
hints that he had in store a poem on Queen Elizabeth,
which might rival “The Faerie Queene:”—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“To taste the streames, that like a golden showre,</div>
      <div class='line'>Flow from thy fruitful head, of thy Love’s praise—</div>
      <div class='line'>Fitter perhaps to thunder martial stowre—</div>
      <div class='line'>When so thee list thy lofty Muse to raise;</div>
      <div class='line in2'><em>Yet till that thou thy poem wilt make known</em>,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Let thy faire Cynthia’s praises be thus rudely shown.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>But poetic effusions are not the only contributions of
Raleigh to literature. During his long confinement in
the Tower, on charge of treason, he relieved his solitude
by compiling a “History of the World;” an undertaking
sufficient to appal the most active and learned man under
the most favourable circumstances, but which appears
something superhuman when attempted and almost accomplished
by a wretched prisoner lying under an unjust
sentence of death.</p>

<p class='c007'>This History commences at the Creation, and descends
as far as the end of the second Macedonian War; when,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>in consequence of the death of Prince Henry, for whose
instruction it was intended, he ceased from his arduous
labours. The work displays a vast extent of reading in
history, philosophy, theology, and Rabbinical learning.</p>

<p class='c007'>Like Raleigh, Sir Philip Sidney combined the characters
of the warrior and the author. His Arcadia was a
work of poetic prose, better suited to the time in which
he lived than to any subsequent period, and is almost
forgotten; and the stiffness and hard formality of his
poetry has almost sunk it in like oblivion. A writer who
is not an author for all time, may be a very useful and
agreeable one in his day, but lacks power and thoughtfulness.
It is only those who have the “one touch of
Nature” which “makes the whole world kin,” that are
independent of time, and live with the kindred spirits
of all ages.</p>

<p class='c007'>Time puts out the lesser lights which burn only to
light some small apartment and corner of the world, but
cannot extinguish the suns which are formed to illuminate
the whole earth.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sir Philip Sidney was rather a discerning patron of
letters than a man of letters. He was the first patron
and friend of Spenser, whom he introduced to the Queen,
and their friendship endured till Sidney’s lamented death.
Perhaps in the whole range of literary history, there is
no incident so beautiful as the mutual friendship and
familiar intercourse of Raleigh, Spenser, and Sidney.
This pleasing friendship is frequently alluded to by
Spenser. The ‘Faerie Queene’ is dedicated to Raleigh,
whose return from his Western Expedition is celebrated
in the Pastoral, entitled, “Colin Clout’s come home
again;” from which we learn that it was their custom
to recline</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>“... amongst the coolly shade</div>
      <div class='line'>Of the green alders by the Mulla’s shore,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>and recite to each other their poetic effusions.</p>

<p class='c007'>How beautiful a picture of the simplicity of great
minds! It strikes us as a more lovely picture than the
much-admired one of Chaucer, solitary among the daisies
of the Woodstock meadows.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>Sidney inspired Spenser with no mere mercenary friendship,
the affection of the client for his patron’s substantial
marks of favour. When death smote Sidney on the sad
field of Zutphen, Spenser invoked every Muse to weep
over his untimely fall, and celebrated his virtues in the
beautiful elegy “The Tears of the Muses for Astrophel.”
It will perhaps relieve the dryness of our subject, to
observe that the first poetical use of the Forget-me-not,
(<em>Myosotis palustris</em>) as a symbol of faithfulness, occurs
in this poem, and the English reader may there find a
more fitting reason to esteem this little flower than the
absurd German legend of a drowning knight throwing a
spray of it to his ladye-love.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Astrophel of the following lines from Spenser’s
Elegy, is Sidney; Stella is the name by which Sidney
addressed his Mistress, who, it is feigned, was unable to
survive his loss, and,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>“... followed her mute, like turtle chaste,</div>
      <div class='line'>To prove that death their hearts cannot divide,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which, living, were in love so firmly tied.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The Gods which all things see, this same beheld;</div>
      <div class='line'>And pittying this paire of lovers trew,</div>
      <div class='line'>Transformed them, there lying on the field,</div>
      <div class='line'>Into one flowre, that is both red and blew.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>It first growes red, and then to blew doth fade,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Like Astrophel, which thereinto was made.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And in the midst thereof a starre appeares,</div>
      <div class='line'>As fairly formed as any starre in skyes,</div>
      <div class='line'>Resembling Stella in her freshest yeeres,</div>
      <div class='line'>Forth darting beames of beautie from her eyes</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And all the day it standeth full of deow,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Which is the teares, that from her eyes did flow.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>That hearb of some, Starlight is call’d by name,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of others, Penthia, though not so well;</div>
      <div class='line'>But thou, whenever thou dost find the same,</div>
      <div class='line'>From this day forth doe call it Astrophel.</div>
      <div class='line'>And whensoever thou it up doost take,</div>
      <div class='line'>Doe pluck it softly for that shepheard’s sake.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>May the injunction of the last lines never be forgotten
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>by any one who knows that the Forget-me-not is associated
with the friendship of two such noble-minded men!</p>

<p class='c007'>It is hardly necessary to say that Sir Philip Sidney fell
gallantly fighting at the battle of Zutphen, or to narrate the
interesting anecdote of his refusing a drink of cold water
till a wounded soldier had partaken of it, saying, “Thy
necessity is yet greater than mine;” thus nobly displaying
both firm endurance (I.) and sensitive humanity (II.)</p>

<p class='c007'>The other instances, <span class='sc'>Alexander the Great</span>, and
<span class='sc'>Napoleon</span>, may be best treated of by contrasting them
with their opposites; and we shall thus be enabled to
illustrate, at the same time, both the Roman and the
Greek Noses more fully. Moreover, while the contrast
will clearly demonstrate the distinctive characteristics of
those Noses, it will also evince how important it is to
attend to compound forms, and how materially the character
is affected by the intermixture of classes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of all the conquerors whose wild ambition has stained
with blood the page of History, Alexander and Napoleon
alone fought from a high romantic motive—the desire
of eternal fame. By virtue of a large share of the Roman
Nose, they pursued their favourite and chosen career with
determined energy and a reckless disregard for the lives
of others; nevertheless, being strongly gifted with the
Greek, they might in some other sphere have been high
artists of some class; but having the sword in their hands,
they pursued intellectual fame by its means.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is difficult to say whether the Roman or the Greek
form predominates in their Noses; for they are perhaps
as much Greco-Roman as Romano-Greek; but as they
were warriors, we place them here because it will be
advantageous to draw an illustrative contrast between
their characters and Noses, and the characters and Noses
of too many other mere conquerors, whose Noses have
been purely Roman.</p>

<p class='c007'>Let us briefly contrast Julius Cæsar and Alexander.
They were both, in the prime of life, placed at the head
of a large empire, firmly seated, with a large army and
all the world open to their grasp. Their Noses alone
differed. Alexander, while pursuing everlasting fame by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>his arms, and earning what was then deemed the highest
glory, steadily devoted himself to the extension of scientific
knowledge. Under his revered master Aristotle, he
acquired much learning, and, when he ascended his
father’s throne, devoted his arms as much to the conquest
of the then unknown realms of science as of the
kingdoms of the earth. His army was always accompanied
by learned men, whose sole duty it was to investigate
the history, religion, and arts of the countries he
passed through, to collect rare animals and plants, statues,
coins, and objects of art or curiosity to be transmitted to
Greece for the study of his master Aristotle. It has been
well said, “If there had been no Alexander, there would
have been no Aristotle.” We do not laud the man who
sought glory by the destruction of others, but merely
assert that, as these acts prove, his motive to arms was
a high intellectual one, and consistent with the compound
character of his Nose.</p>

    <div>(<em>From gems in the Florentine Museum.</em>)</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Look at Julius Cæsar on the other hand. Under
similar circumstances, what was his ambition? To make
himself imperial master of Rome, and to subject his
fellow-citizens for his own personal aggrandizement. His
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>thoughts never extended beyond his own immediate existence.
Posterity never entered into his calculations. Unlike
his successor Augustus—though he had greater facilities if
he had been less sensually ambitious—he patronised no
art—literary or scientific. His one idea was self, without
one refinement or softening alloy. Granted that Alexander’s
ambition was also selfish, there was yet this
difference between them; the one (Cæsar) sought only
his <em>present personal</em> and <em>sensuous</em> profit; the other
(Alexander) laboured to earn “a name on History’s page
to make him ‘<span class='sc'>Great</span>.’” The one was the common prose,
the other the epic poem. The one sacrificed his fame to
himself, the other himself to his fame; and the world has
recognized and recorded this distinction: for while the
one is remembered as “the enslaver of his country,” the
other is immortalized as “the Great.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A similar contrast may be drawn between the characters
and noses of the two modern heroes, Napoleon and Wellington.
Like Alexander and Cæsar, the only point in
which their characters assimilate is their warrior, physical
energy; and this exhibits itself in whatever is Roman in
their Noses. In all other respects they are diametrically
opposite; the Nose of Wellington being purely (almost in
excess) Roman; while Napoleon’s partakes largely of the
refining qualities of the Greek.</p>

<p class='c007'>To describe the character of Napoleon would be to
repeat what we have said of Alexander; for whether the
similarity was accidental, or arose from mental conformity
(their Noses were remarkably alike), or was intentionally imitative
on the part of the former,<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c012'><sup>[20]</sup></a> it is certainly most striking.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ambition of future fame was far more the ruling passion
of Napoleon than lust of present power. His mind, with
all its imperfections and meannesses (as whose is without?),
was too noble to be satisfied with mere personal
aggrandizement.</p>

<p class='c007'>All the great mistakes of his life were occasioned by his
obedience to the passion for future fame. When swayed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>by the mere desire of power, all his acts were successful.
But when he saw all Europe (except one little pugnacious
island) lying helpless at his feet, he began to revolve schemes
which could not enhance, but might risk, his personal power.
Then he attempted to realize his long-cherished dream of
Eastern conquest—a conquest not to be held, but to be
overrun; a conquest like that of Alexander, Nadir Shah,
or Zinghis Khan. Often did he exclaim, “the seat of
all fame is the east.” To realize this empty fame,
he took the false step of invading Egypt. Foiled there,
he still hoped to penetrate Asia by land, and gathered all
his strength to overwhelm Russia, his last and greatest
error. They greatly err who think these were mere
schemes to keep France embroiled, lest peace should annihilate
his power. They equally err who ridicule and
attribute to a childish vanity his ambition to link himself
by marriage with the imperial families of Europe. It was
no childish vanity, but a politic endeavour to found a
dynasty, which should hand down his name as its founder
to the latest ages. They again who can see nothing better
in the melancholy spectacle of Napoleon at St. Helena,
engaged in falsifying records and altering figures to
deceive the world, than a drivelling vanity, utterly miscomprehend
the man. Fame, fame to the utmost limits of
human duration, was to his last moment his highest
ambition. Foiled in everything else, he yet hoped to
secure fame. He knew that under his name the most
eventful page in the History of Europe, since the fall of
Rome, must be written, and he naturally desired</p>

<p class='c007'>To describe the character of Wellington, is to reverse
that of Napoleon. Napoleon was shrewd, artful, and
deceitful; Wellington open-hearted, strong-sensed, candid,
and sincere. Napoleon a clever statesman; Wellington
obtuse in politics. Napoleon a great strategist; Wellington
short-sighted, though daring in the field. Napoleon
a lover and patron of arts; Wellington a despiser of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>them. Napoleon said to be personally timid; Wellington
constitutionally brave. Napoleon’s cruelties were acts of
cool calculation and state-policy; Wellington’s of military
fury. Napoleon poisoned his sick troops because he did
not know what else to do with them, and murdered the
Duke d’Enghien to produce “an effect” in Europe; Wellington’s
cruelties were the necessary consequences of war
energetically carried on, and were never the result of
cold-blooded predetermination.<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c012'><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Before closing this section, we would request the reader’s
attention to the strong proof of the truth of the hypothesis
derivable from the fact that like Noses, with like
circumstances (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cæteris paribus</span></i>, as the phrenologists say),
produce like characters: for instance, Wolsey, Richelieu,
Ximenes, Lorenzo di Medici, Alfred:—Sidney, Raleigh:—Alexander,
Napoleon.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER III.<br /> <span class='large'>OF THE GREEK NOSE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Class II.</span>—<span class='sc'>The Greek</span>, or straight Nose, is perfectly straight; any
deviation from a right line must be strictly noticed. If the
deviation tend to convexity, it approaches the Roman, and the
character is improved by an accession of energy; on the other
hand, when the deviation is towards concavity, it partakes of the
Celestial, and the character is weakened. It should be fine, and
well chiselled, but not sharp.</p>

<p class='c017'>It indicates Refinement of character; love for the Fine Arts, and
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Belles-Lettres</span></i>; astuteness, craft, and a preference for indirect
rather than direct action. Its owner is not without some energy
in pursuit of that which is agreeable to his tastes; but, unlike the
owner of the Roman Nose, he cannot exert himself in <em>opposition</em>
to his tastes. When associated with the Roman Nose, and distended
slightly at the end by the Cogitative, it indicates the most
useful and intellectual of characters, and is the highest and most
beautiful form which the organ can assume.</p>
<p class='c006'>This Nose, like the Roman, takes its name from the
people of whom it was most characteristic—physically
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>and mentally. On these two parallel facts (with others of a
like kind) much stress maybe justly laid, although they are
old and trite. But this very triteness is the proof of their
truth. It proves that the hypothesis which attributes certain
mental characteristics, well known to belong to the
Romans, to the Roman Nose,—and so of the Greeks to the
Greek Nose, and of the Jews to the Jewish Nose,—is
founded in nature; and, so far from being a fanciful invention,
is a fact long recognized, and as old as the creation of
the human proboscis.</p>

<p class='c007'>Requesting the reader to bear in mind the form of the
Greek Nose and its indications, we would remark how
exactly the latter correspond with the character of the
ancient Greeks as a nation. It is unnecessary to expatiate
on their high excellence in art, their lofty philosophy,
their acute reasoning, or their poetical inspiration—these
are known to every school-boy. Their craftiness, their
political falsehood, and shrewd deceitfulness, were celebrated
in ancient days as now, and “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Græcia mendax</span></i>,”
“<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Danaûm insidiæ</span></i>,” were epithets as true and as commonly
applied in the time of Augustus, as at the present
hour by modern travellers. “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Timeo Danaos et dona
ferentes!</span></i>” exclaims the cautious Priest of Troy, referring to
the well-known character of the treacherous enemy. And
what a contrast to anything recorded in Roman warfare
does the Trojan War itself exhibit! The Romans would
have battered down the walls with their furious engines;
the wily Greeks invent a stratagem by which the enemy
pull down their own walls. If we may credit Homer—and,
if not for the facts, we may for his fine portraitures
of Grecian character—there was a vast deal more talking
than fighting during the ten years’ siege. There was
plenty of the <em>morale</em>, but very little of the <em>physique</em>, as a
Frenchman would say. In truth, the contrast between
the Romans and the Greeks was as great in the latter as
in the former.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Greeks were no nation of hardy warriors, though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>they were always quarrelling among themselves in petty
battles which have won an undeserved celebrity by the
talents of their historians. Were it not for the writings
of Thucydides, the Peloponnesian War would rank
no higher than the border skirmishes of the Scots and
Northumbrians, or the expeditions of the Sioux and
Pawnees. A simple geographical fact is sufficient to
prove this against all the moral power of the most glowing
and eloquent historian. Greece is about one-fourth less
than Scotland, and its recorded population was about the
same. Is it possible that, in such a corner, a war of seven-and-twenty
years’ duration could have been more than a
series of skirmishes and predatory expeditions? More
than that must, in a much briefer space, have annihilated
the whole population. More than that, and at the end of
twenty-seven years the States of Greece must have been
in the condition of the celebrated Kilkenny cats, which
fought till only the tip of the tail of one of them was left.
The battles of Marathon, Thermopylæ, &amp;c., against foreign
foes, rank higher, because they were fought and won under
a high intellectual inspiration, entirely consistent with
Class II.—the love of country. But with these battles
the war ended; the Greeks did not, as the Romans would
have done, follow up the defeat of the enemy with a
counter-incursion into his country and an attempt at
foreign conquest. He was driven from their territory;
their hearths were secure; their gods replaced on their
pedestals; their temples re-purified, and that satisfied
<em>their</em> ambition. The Greeks made no foreign conquests;
boasted no extended empire. The wars of Alexander
seem the only exception; but of that Monarch himself we
have already treated, and of his battles it may be said,
that they were not fought by Peloponnesian Greeks (of
whom we are now speaking) but by Macedonians and
Asiatic mercenaries; who were, in all probability—though
it would demand a volume on ethnography to prove it—a
wholly different race.</p>

<p class='c007'>But, if we were only prepared to substantiate our hypothesis
by these general facts of national characteristics, it
would be very unsatisfactory; as it is obvious that nothing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>could be easier than to manufacture and support a theory
by moulding it to a single general fact. It is by the
multiplicity of isolated <em>individual</em> cases that the hypothesis
must stand or fall. And we are happily in a position again
to adduce these in its favour.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following persons will, on an examination of their
portraits, be found to have possessed Greek Noses:—</p>

<p>RAFFAELLE.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>It will be perceived that this list (which, like all the
others, might be very much extended) contains the names
of poets and artists of the highest <em>beauty</em> and elegance,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>though not of the most intense and deepest <em>thought</em>.
Beauty is their highest excellence, their chief praise.
Exquisite melody, ætherial fancies, felicitous expression, a
fine perception of the Beautiful, as distinguished from the
Sublime, whether on paper or canvass, (for it is only the
difference in the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mécanique</span></i>, or vehicle of expression, which
constitutes the difference between the Artist and the Poet),
are their best attributes. Addison and Voltaire are the
only two of the above instances who never excelled in
Poetry or Art, though both assiduously courted the former
Muse. Nevertheless Addison is an illustrious instance in
our behalf. Is not the <em>beauty</em>, the correctness, the euphony
of his style still an object of emulation? Has it not for
above a century been the model of good writing? And yet
it is too true that nothing equally permanent can be found,
which is at the same time so weak and tame in thought, so
shallow in reasoning, or so lax in argument. In fact, it
owes all its permanency to its euphony, its musical harmony
and exactness of expression.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_p047.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic004'>
<p>ADDISON.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The absence of a noticeable development of the Cogitative
(Class III.) accounts for the deficiency of higher qualities
in these disciples of the Beautiful. For this reason
the Greek nose is more interesting in its compound form,
Sub-class <span class='fraction'>II<br /><span class='vincula'>III</span></span> the “<em>Greco-Cogitative</em>,” than in its simple form.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>Of the above instances, Voltaire is the most decidedly
deficient in the Cogitative, which is always essential to indicate
a capacity for the deep, close and serious thought
requisite to constitute a truly great and philosophic mind.
The angle at which his nose stood from his face was quite
45°, and therefore much too great to exhibit faithfully the
higher characteristics of the Greek. It was, moreover,
exceedingly deficient in the broadening property of Class
III; and we presume that no one will assert that Voltaire
possessed “a truly great and philosophic mind.” Surely
no man, who ever wrote so much, and on such varied subjects,
ever devoted less time to close intense thought. He
did not even stop to examine his facts; but, having a brilliant
wit and “the pen of a ready writer,” he rapidly
evolved some fanciful theory, or started some fallacious
argument from such unauthenticated data as he happened
to be possessed of. All this was indicated by his sharp
Greek Nose; for it was acuteness, not depth; readiness,
not thought; careless, unprincipled wit, not study; attractive
style, not sound matter, which earned him his short-lived
fame. Hence, Voltaire, though striving all his life
to gain the title of philosopher, never succeeded even in
the most unphilosophic age and country since the revival
of learning, and is now, we believe, wholly excluded from
the dignity. It has been truly and wittily said of Voltaire,
that “he <em>half</em> knew everything, ‘from the cedar tree that
is in Lebanon, even unto the hyssop that springeth out of
the wall,’ and he wrote of them all, and laughed at them
all.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It will be noticed that the foregoing list contains the
name of “Milton, <em>in youth</em>.” It is inserted thus, because
his portrait, taken <em>ætat.</em> XXIII, shows that his Nose was
not then developed into the Cogitative form which it
assumed in later years, when troublous times and anxious
cares caused him to reflect profoundly on events around
him. Then it expanded at the base and became, like the
Noses of all the great men of those stirring times, largely
compounded with the Cogitative; under the compounds of
which class it will again, at a later period of his life, appear.
From this corresponding change in feature with change in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>character, we might, if we thought proper, demand the
same proof for our system which the phrenologists demand
for theirs, from the gradual alteration in the skull of the boy
Bidder; and though (as our system is, we conceive, better
based than theirs) it is unnecessary to lay as much stress upon
a single fact as they are compelled to do, yet we think it
right not to let this proof pass wholly without observation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having already treated at some length of the Romano-Greek
Nose (Sub-class <span class='fraction'>I<br /><span class='vincula'>II</span></span>.), it is unnecessary to enlarge
here upon its close ally the Greco-Roman <span class='fraction'><span class='under'>II</span><br />I</span>. Of course
they are somewhat similar in appearance and character;
only as in every compound form, one simple one will generally
prevail—Nature, like a bad cook, not always mixing
her ingredients in due proportions—it is necessary to distinguish
them into different sub-classes.</p>

<p class='c007'>A noticeable predominance of one form will at once indicate
to which sub-class a Nose belongs, and the character
will be found to be affected accordingly. Thus a Romano-Greek
Nose indicates a more energetic and less refined
character than a Greco-Roman. But these are the minutiæ
of the science, with which it is not advisable at present
to embarrass the reader.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IV.<br /> <span class='large'>OF THE COGITATIVE NOSE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Class III.</span>—<span class='sc'>The Cogitative</span>, or Wide-Nostrilled Nose, is, as its
secondary name imports, wide at the end, thick and broad, not
clubbed, but <em>gradually</em> widening from below the bridge. The
other Noses are seen in profile, but this in full face.</p>

<p class='c017'>It indicates a Cogitative mind, having strong powers of Thought,
and given to close and serious Meditation. Its indications are of
course much dependent on the form of the Nose in profile, which
decides the turn the Cogitative power will take. Of course it
never occurs alone, and is usually associated with Classes I. and
II. rarely with IV., still more seldom with V. and VI. The entire
absence of it produces the “sharp” Nose, which is not classified, a
sharpness is only a negative quality, being defect of breadth, and
therefore indicates defect of Cogitative power.</p>
<p class='c006'>It is manifest that without some portion of the Cogitative
power, <em>i. e.</em>, the capacity of concentrating the thoughts
earnestly and powerfully in one focus, no character can be
truly great. It is therefore a quality essential to high and
durable eminence in every department of life. It matters
not what a man’s natural talents may be, they will be
utterly useless, or worse than useless, if he has not schooled
his mind into habits of concentrated thought. It is the
want of this severe training which causes so many men of
fine talents to be a burden to themselves and others. How
frequently have we to lament the humiliating spectacle of
a great genius—as the phrase is—flitting about from pursuit
to pursuit, without any settled end or aim; now
attempting this thing, now dabbling in that; doing all
things tolerably well, but nothing perfectly; aiming at
everything, but holding fast to nothing; and merely from
want of steady settled habits of thought! How melancholy
is it to reflect that the want of self-training in early
life has converted the blessing of talents into a curse, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>turned the fine wheat of heaven’s planting into the rank
tares of Hell!</p>

<p class='c007'>It is from beholding this too frequent spectacle that
dull-pated Ignorance repeats with self-complacency the
trite proverb, “Geniuses rarely do any good for themselves,”
professes to despise the talents in which he is
consciously deficient, and thanks God that He has not made
him a genius.</p>

<p class='c007'>Begone, thou muddle-pated imbecile! and learn that it
is not his genius which has made him what he is, but the
want of that in which you equally fail—self-training.
Instead of idly despising the noblest gifts of Heaven,
strive, from his example, to avoid the rock on which he
has split, and endeavour, by stern, close, severe mental
discipline, to elevate yourself to a fractional part of the
high estate from which he has fallen. Pull him not down
to your debasement, but soar upward towards the eminence
which he has voluntarily (alas!) abandoned; well assured
that though <em>you</em> may never reach it, your labour will not
have been in vain, but that you may yet place yourself
far above the level of the common despisers of genius.</p>

<p class='c007'>But to our subject—the Cogitative Nose. This Nose
long puzzled us. We found it among men of all pursuits,
from the warrior to the peaceful theologian. Noticing
it more particularly among the latter, we were at one
time inclined to call it the religious Nose; but further
observation convincing us that that term was too limited,
we were compelled to abandon it. We were next, from
seeing it frequent among scientific men, disposed to call
it the philosophic Nose; but this was found to be too
confined also, as, in the modern acceptation of the term,
it seemed to exclude the theologians, and we moreover
traced it accompanying other and very different conditions
of mind. It soon became manifest, however, that it was
noticeable only among very first-rate men (men of the very
<em>highest</em> excellence in their several departments), and that
search must be made for some common property of mind
which however directed by other causes, would always lead
to eminence. It appeared to us that this property was deep,
close Meditation, intense concentrated Thought, eminently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>“cogitative” in fact; and, therefore, we adopted this term,
which permits to have included in it all serious thinkers,
whatever the subject of their cogitations.</p>

<p class='c007'>It would be wrong to regard it as a mere coincidence,
that, after having from deduction <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à posteriori</span></i> learnt that
this common property is exhibited in the <em>breadth</em> of the
Nose, we find that if we were, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à priori</span></i>, to consider in
which part of the Nose a <em>common</em> property was to be looked
for, we must decide it to be in the <em>breadth</em>, for the profile
is already in every part mapped out and appropriated to
<em>special</em> properties.</p>

<p class='c007'>May we not hail this as one of the beautiful harmonious
truths which spring up from time to time, the deeper the
subject is investigated, to attest the accuracy of the system?
for where by a careful deduction, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à posteriori</span></i>, we
discover the common property is, there, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à priori</span></i>, we perceive
it must be in order to act in concert with the <em>special</em>
properties exhibited by the profile.</p>

<p class='c007'>To entitle a Nose to rank among the Cogitatives, it
should be above the medium between the very full broad
Nose, and the very sharp thin Nose. The observation is
to be confined to the parts <em>below</em> the bridge; what may
be the properties of breadth <em>above</em> the bridge we have not
at present observed satisfactorily. It may be remarked as
a general rule, that the further a Nose recedes from sharpness
the better.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have said that minds of every bias are found accompanying
Cogitative Noses, and this necessarily; for the
tendency of the cogitations will be determined by the profile.
Thus the Cogitative acts in concert with the other
Noses, making useful those qualities which would, otherwise,
for ever slumber unknown. The very best Nose in
profile may be utterly worthless from defect of breadth;
for, as before observed, no talent is of any use without
Cogitative power; and every Nose, having breadth as well
as length (profile), must be submitted to the test of this
Class before a judgment is pronounced upon it. Being,
however, anxious to simplify the subject, we have not, in
our notices of Classes I. and II., remarked specially on the
Cogitative part of their formation, and have reserved until
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>this chapter the instances of those Classes partaking largely
of Class III.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the present brief sketch of the science, however, we
shall not attempt to distinguish our instances under the
heads of distinct profiles, as, Romano-Cogitative, Greco-Cogitative,
&amp;c.; but class together all the compounds partaking
sufficiently of the Cogitative form to entitle them
to a place among Cogitative Noses.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the above instances every one is compounded with
Class I, or II, or both; and would be written <span class='fraction'>I<br /><span class='vincula'>III</span></span>, or <span class='fraction'>II<br /><span class='vincula'>III</span></span>,
or <span class='fraction'><span class='under'>I + II</span><br />III</span>, or <span class='fraction'><span class='under'>II + I</span><br />III</span>, according to the class or sub-class of
profile to which it might belong.</p>

<p class='c007'>The list given is more extensive than usual; yet it
might be much extended, and should comprise all the
greatest names in Theology, Science, and Art.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been said, that “the form of the Nose in profile,
decides the turn which the Cogitative power will take.”
Thus the Romano-Cogitative will prefer to exercise its
cogitativeness in the bustle of active life, and Washington
and Cromwell present remarkable proofs of the truth of
this assertion. Another striking instance is the energetic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>and fervent John Knox, who bearded monarchs on
their thrones, and lawless nobles in their strongholds.</p>

<p class='c007'>But we must again guard the reader against the assumption
that energy of character can only be displayed in
physical action.</p>

<p class='c007'>The energy of the Romano-Cogitative may display itself
in a vigorous and nervous style of literary composition,
and so be distinguished from the beauty and euphony indicated
by the Greco-Cogitative. The former will disregard
style, if it interfere with the force and power of expression,
or weakens the vigour and terseness of an important paragraph;
while the latter will labour and polish his style
till the sense is almost obliterated, and little remains but a
beautiful and melodious sound.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Luther</span>, whose Nose was highly Roman, is an illustrious
example that Power and Energy may be displayed
otherwise than in physical action, and many other examples
might be cited, were it necessary to substantiate a
proposition which every reader may confirm for himself
by examination of any accurately illustrated General Biography.
But we cite Luther, because he presents a contrast,
both in feature and mind, to many other men of the
same nation, warm friends, ardently embarked in the same
cause, impressed with the same truths, and equally desirous
to propagate them for the enlightenment and salvation
of their fellow-men.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Luther we behold a man of intense Energy and
undaunted Firmness; bold, forward, ever rushing into
action; attacking Falsehood everywhere; volunteering his
theses; challenging disputation; ever in wars of words,
regardless of danger; fearless of death, imprisonment, or
torture; reckless whom he offended—rather seeking to
offend—careless of other’s feelings; coarse, violent, and
repulsive in language; indifferent in what terms he propounded
truth or exposed error. Thus did the intense
Energy, prompt Decision, and immovable Firmness, with
the coarseness and disregard to his own and others’ physical
welfare, indicated by his Roman Nose, display themselves
in Luther, to his own detriment, the sorrow of his
friends, the loss of many adherents, and the still-continued
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>scoffs of the enemies and the censure of the friends of the
Reformation.</p>

<p class='c007'>In contrast with the fully-developed Cogitativeness of
the Noses of Luther, Wickliff, Cranmer, and other leaders
in the Reformation, may be placed the Nose of a man who
was called to take a prominent part in the same movement,
but whose deficiency in thoughtfulness and serious determination
paralyzed his usefulness, and flung him back into
the abyss of Romanism, from which his soul naturally
revolted. We allude to Erasmus. His nose was a sharp
Greek nose, indicative of the refinement and delicacy of
mind which made him a Reformer in heart, and of the
want of cogitative power which disabled him from joining
the good cause when adherence to it called for serious
enterprise and thoughtful energy. He was content to be
a Reformer in heart only, and thus became the lukewarm
enemy of both Romanists and Protestants. He lashed the
vices and follies of the monks in sharp satires; but he
shrunk from interference when the intensely energetic and
Roman-Nosed Luther would have annihilated them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The historian of the Reformation thus describes him.<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c012'><sup>[22]</sup></a>
“In the result Erasmus knew not on which side to range
himself. None pleased him, and he dreaded all. ‘It is
dangerous to speak,’ said he, ‘and dangerous to be silent.’
In all great religious movements there are such undecided
characters—respectable in some things, but hindering the
truth, and who, from a desire to displease no one, displease
all.” Erasmus, though a clever and learned man, lacked
the wisdom and sagacity necessary to penetrate the future.
He could criticize a Greek historian, and correct the Greek
Testament, but he could not discern the signs of the
times. Timid and retiring by nature, he feared to fail in
the contest with the spirits of darkness; he had no confidence
in the righteousness of the cause of the Reformation,
and, knowing his constitutional weakness, shrunk
from the penalties of failure. A sagacity and power of
penetration equal to that of his more cogitative brother-Reformers
would have cured his cowardice by shewing
him its causelessness. Luther, on the other hand, feared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>nothing; he knew that the truth, if energetically urged,
must prevail,—though it would be crushed, if permitted
to lie quietly dormant. Truth will not conquer of its own
force; it must be promulgated, insisted on, and brought
home to men’s minds. They will not seek it, preferring
rather to enjoy the peaceable stagnation of error. While
Luther was respected and admired even by his bitterest
enemies, Erasmus was despised by all parties. His vacillation
was aptly hit off by a cotemporary, who, in one of
his works depicting two heavens, the Papal and the Christian,
says, “I find Erasmus in neither; but perceive him
incessantly wheeling, in never-ending eddies between
both.” Certainly a fitting destination for the man who
advises his friend to dissemble his opinions, as a certain
dying man eluded the devil. The devil asked him what
he believed? The dying man, fearing to be surprised into
some heresy, answered, “What the Church believes.”
“What does the Church believe?” persisted his Satanic
enemy. “What I believe,” replied the cautious man.
Again, the devil, “And what do you believe?” “What
the Church believes.” Whereupon the devil, being unable
to convict him of lax Churchism, left him to the mercy of
the Pope, who, he knew, would deal with him after his—gifts
for <em>pious uses</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the pencil of the Artist be the adopted vehicle of
thought, the natural differences of character will be equally
betrayed. Thus the Romano-Cogitative Michael Angelo
exhibited the thoughtful energy of his mind in a fervid
and exaggerated opinion of the fiercest passions, and delighted
in representations—not always the most refined—of
scenes from which most minds revolt, to which he even
added a horror all his own. The exaggerated action and
muscular development of Michael Angelo’s figures, the
gigantic scale on which he preferred to draw them, and
the stupendous works which he unhesitatingly undertook,
betray an energetic and coarse mind, quite accordant with
his Roman profile. The Greek-Nosed Raffaelle, on the
other hand, paid exclusive attention to beauty of form,
and the pourtraying of the gentler and more amiable sentiments,
especially of the female character. He was never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>betrayed into any extravagancies of action or passion; but
delighted to dwell on the peaceful holiness and gentle sentiment
of the Virgin Mother and the Infant Jesus, or the
graceful virtues of the female saints.</p>

<p>HOBBES.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>The major part of our illustrations being taken from
purely literary men, present Greco-Cogitative Noses. It
is not our intention to descant at length on persons whose
works are well known, by name at least, to every one,
and whose lives were, for the most part, passed in the
usual monotonous tenour of those of literary men; but
Bacon may be referred to as an important corroborative
instance of the shrewd, wily measures by which the astute
Greek prefers to further his ambition. Bacon as a man
presents such a lamentable contrast to Bacon as a philosopher,
and the wretched underhand means by which he
attained eminence are so well known, and so painful to
dwell upon, that we refrain from doing more than referring
the reader to the facts for comparison with his profile.
Wretchedly inconsistent as his character appears, it is
not inconsistent with his Nose; and, perhaps, what are
termed his inconsistencies, are only a proof that the intellectual
and moral powers are distinct, and that the most
profuse development of the former, cannot compensate for
a deficiency of the latter.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is unnecessary to dissertate upon the names in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>present list in order to demonstrate their right to appear
among the Cogitatives. No one will deny their title to
that most enviable epithet, and it would be by portraits
alone that the identity between their minds and noses
could be exhibited to any who are incredulous on that
subject. To such we can only say, examine for yourselves;
the portraits are, for the most part, easily attainable; and
an attentive examination of them will well repay the
labour, and, without doubt, satisfy the most sceptical of
the truth of the hypothesis.</p>

<p class='c007'>The names on that list are, for the most part, names
which are a volume in themselves: they write their own
history; certainly no encomiums of ours can add anything
to their glory. It is undeniable that it was by close
cogitation, serious, hard thinking, that each of them
obtained a place in the rolls of Fame; and it is equally
certain that almost every person may, by the same process
obtain, if not an equal, yet certainly no mean place in
the same estimable record.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is a common and veracious observation, that certain
faces prevail in certain ages; but it may be further
added, that this epochal character frequently arises from
the formation of the Nose, more especially of the Cogitative
part.</p>

<p class='c007'>Up to about the close of the reign of James I. the
Greco-Cogitative prevailed; during the time of Charles I.
and the Protectorate, the Romano-Cogitative was almost
universal, and the Cogitative part was much increased in
intensity. The Noses of the time are remarkably broad
and thick, a circumstance which can only be attributed
to the serious religious and political questions which then
agitated the minds of all men. With the careless dissipated
days of the second Charles came in the thin, long
Greek, or Greco-Roman Nose, with little or none of the
Cogitative element; and this for the most part prevailed
up to the commencement of the present century. What
future ages may determine to be the form of Nose characteristic
of our age it is impossible to say. <em>We</em> can form
no accurate judgment, for time alone can separate the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>tares from the wheat, and decide who are the great men
of our age.</p>

<p class='c007'>To an observant mind there is something very remarkable
in the striking contrast between the physiognomies of the
leaders in our own Rebellion (as it is historically termed)
and of those of the French revolutionists. Besides a
certain serious determination, a stern, unflinching, dogged
consciousness of right, that nothing could turn to the right
hand or to the left, which is visible in the countenances
of the former, and to be contrasted with the flippant,
wicked, blood-thirsty-looking smirk of the latter, there
is a remarkable contrast in their Noses. The thick, broad,
Cogitative Nose is visible in all of the former, from Old
Noll himself to honest Andrew Marvel; while the void
of thought, sharp, captious, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vulpine</span></i> Nose is to be seen
in every one of the bloody tyrants of the French <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans-culotterie</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The latter look like men who</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Could smile, and murder while they smile.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The former like men who</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Put their trust in God, and keep their powder dry.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Wordsworth has so splendidly and truly contrasted the
men of either age that we cannot resist inserting his
lines entire:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Great men have been among us; hands that penned</div>
      <div class='line'>And tongues that uttered wisdom—better none;</div>
      <div class='line'>The later Sydney, Marvel, Harrington,</div>
      <div class='line'>Young Vane, and others who called Milton friend.</div>
      <div class='line'>These moralists could act and comprehend;</div>
      <div class='line'>They knew how genuine glory was put on;</div>
      <div class='line'>Taught us how rightfully a nation shone</div>
      <div class='line'>In splendour; what strength was, that would not ben</div>
      <div class='line'>But in magnanimous meekness. France, ’tis strange,</div>
      <div class='line'>Hath brought forth no such souls as we had then.</div>
      <div class='line'>Perpetual emptiness! unceasing change!</div>
      <div class='line'>No single volume paramount, no code,</div>
      <div class='line'>No master-spirit, no determined road;—</div>
      <div class='line'>But equally a want of Books and Men!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In the fifth line, “These moralists could <em>act</em> <span class='fss'>AND</span> <em>comprehend</em>,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>we have a beautiful and exact paraphrase of
the Romano-Cogitative, which we noticed as characteristic
of the Cromwellian age—the union of physical energy
with mental power.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a remark which we heard made some thirty
years ago, by a very observant man, that there was a
wonderful identity of expression in the countenances of
all the men of the French Revolution, and that the same
peculiar expression is to be seen in the faces of the
conspirators of the Gunpowder Plot. Subsequent personal
observation has confirmed this remark, of which it
is a curious and recent corroboration, that the same
expression is visible in the countenances of some of the
leading Terrorists of the late French Revolution.<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c012'><sup>[23]</sup></a> The
countenance of “bloody Mary” is an instance of the same
peculiar expression.</p>

<p class='c007'>The old gentleman who made the remark which drew
our infantine attention added, (and it was this perhaps
which impressed it upon our memory) that there was
“<em>blood</em>” written in all their faces.</p>

<p class='c007'>We cannot improve upon this definition, though in
one word, it might also be called a <em>wolfish</em> look—lean,
cruel, hungry, grinning.</p>

<p class='c007'>When treating of the Greek Nose, we stated that the
Nose of Milton expanded into the Cogitative form when,
in the latter part of his life, he was compelled to turn
his thoughts anxiously and seriously to the condition of
his unhappy country, and when, with a holy and unswerving
determination he devoted his whole soul to the composition
of a poem, whose fame should be co-extensive with
the world whose creation it described. We then claimed
this instance of change of form coincident with change of
character, as a proof of the correctness of the hypothesis.
It was however a superfluous precaution, for the coincident
change is equally true in almost every instance of the
Cogitative Nose. No man can alter the profile of his
Nose, but he may increase its latitudinal diameter. As
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>to the former, he must submit to have it what shape God
pleases; as to the latter, he may make it almost any shape
he himself pleases—for the one indicates acquired habits,
the other inherent properties.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Cogitative Nose expands with expanding thoughts
and is therefore rarely, if ever, much developed in youth;
neither, on the other hand, is the very sharp or Noncogitative
Nose frequently visible in early life, for there
are few to whom God has not given the elements of
thought. It is our own faults, therefore, if we throw away
the talents bestowed upon us, and suffer our minds to
degenerate into inanity and our Noses into sharpness.</p>

<p class='c007'>For this reason, it is a laudable ambition in a young
man to cultivate a Cogitative Nose, for he can only do so
by cultivating his mind. And, forasmuch as it is the only
part of the Nose which is under the controul of the owner,
so it is that which can be most distinctly judged of and its
expansion watched; for, though the owner can never see
the perfect profile of his Nose, he may always form a
correct estimate of its <em>breadth</em>. We should be quite
justified in adding this to the numerous proofs of design
in the adaptation of the human body to the soul, but as
many persons cannot surmount a certain sense of the
ridiculous in the subject before us, we forbear. Those
who are impressed with the truth of our system, will at
once admit the inference, and perceive its value in Natural
Theology.<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c012'><sup>[24]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>As it has been deemed unnecessary to extend the present
chapter with any biographical or critical sketches of
the examples adduced in corroboration of Class III, we
will devote the next to the more useful task of inquiring
how a Cogitative Mind and its certain accompaniment, a
Cogitative Nose, may be acquired.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER V.<br /> <span class='large'>HOW TO GET A COGITATIVE NOSE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It is a great and prevalent mistake to imagine that a
Cogitative mind (and Nose) is to be acquired by reading
alone. It is almost certain that, as books multiply, Cogitative
Minds decrease, for how is a man to think, if all his
thinking is done for him? The mind, when constantly
supplied with extraneous thoughts must, without great
care, lose the habit of generating internal ones. All the
greatest thinkers have been the first in their department
of thought. Homer, Dante, Chaucer, Shakspere, Bacon,
&amp;c. These men, as compared with even mediocre men in
our day, had very little learning,—but they had vast
wisdom.</p>

<p class='c007'>Read Bacon’s Novum Organum and Sylva for instance,
and see how few facts there are in them but such as are
either now known to, or laughed at, by every school-boy;
yet direct your attention to the train of thought, to the
generalizations from these simple facts, to the originality
of the deductions, and behold how the dwarf in Knowledge
becomes a giant in Wisdom! It is even true that Bacon
was behind his cotemporaries in many matters of mere
knowledge; yet the majesty of his wisdom was so vast
that it still rules, and ever must rule, the world of science.</p>

<p class='c007'>So, as on the one hand, a man may have wisdom and
yet want knowledge; on the other, he may have all
knowledge and be able to discourse of all things, from
the hyssop to the cedar, and yet want wisdom. It is
of no use to read and accumulate facts if we do not also
<em>think</em>. Better indeed to think and never read, than read
and not think. If a man does not think for himself, if he
does not originate ideas, if books are not to him <em>only</em> the
elements of thought, if he is not fully and immoveably
impressed with the conviction that two and two make five,
or any greater number which the Cogitative Mind can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>evolve, he has no chance of becoming a wise man, whatever
his learning, and however profound his acquaintance
with the thoughts of other men.</p>

<p class='c007'>But you reply, two and two do not, and cannot make
five, &amp;c. We rejoin, they as certainly and unquestionably
do in metaphysics, as they certainly and unquestionably
do not in physics. True, in physics, two and two things,
two and two facts make four, and only four; but if the
mind, when in possession of those four, can generate
nothing more from them, it is a hopeless case with that
mind. If, upon the recipience of such four facts the mind
remains contented with the arithmetical fact that, from
four units it has segregated four, it is, and for ever will,
remain stationary; it has gained nothing, and might as
well have left those four facts in their original units, for
their addition has not added to it one particle of wisdom.</p>

<p class='c007'>Facts are, or ought to be, only the generators of ideas.
Facts in themselves are utterly worthless; it is in their associations,
in their consequences, their bearings on each other;
it is as they support or refute systems, theories and other
mind-born facts, that they are of value. Now, it is only
by the action of mind upon them that they have associations,
consequences, &amp;c. Without mind, facts must for ever
remain units; even though added together, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad infinitum</span></i>,
they have no natural co-unity, no cohesion, no affinity for
each other. A thousand facts added together are still but
a thousand units, unless mind has cohered them into a
system. This done, you clearly have the thousand facts
still, but you have <em>also</em> something infinitely more valuable,
you have a mind-born fact, a deduction, a system, hypothesis,
theory, axiom, or whatever you please to call it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cordially as we hate coining new words, we still more
cordially hate the German fashion of hooking together
two vernacular words and calling the junction an addition
to the language. But we are compelled, in order to save
circumlocution, to coin a word to express those facts which
spring from Mind, whether, as in moral philosophy, purely
metaphysical, or as in natural philosophy, generated by
Mind from Matter, by Reason from Experience. Such
facts we would beg to call noögenisms (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νοος</span>, <em>mens</em>, <em>cogitatio</em>,
and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γενος</span>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">natus</span></i>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">progenies</span></i>); therein including all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>mental offsprings or deductions, whether called hypotheses,
theories, systems, sciences, axioms, aphorisms, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c007'>Noögenisms, therefore, are those facts which mind generates
from other facts without annihilating the latter;
hence it is said that, metaphysically, two and two make
five. Thus, mind, contemplating the physical facts of the
super-position of strata, deduces from and adds to them
this metaphysical fact or noögenism;—Strata were deposited
successively.</p>

<p class='c007'>Herein appears too an essential difference between
Mind and Matter. If diverse substances, having a natural
affinity, be amalgamated, a new substance is obtained, but
the elements are lost. Of hydrogen and oxygen water
may be made, but the gases are forthwith lost in the fluid;
the procedure may be reversed and the water be converted
into gases, but the water has disappeared. This is not so
with mind and noögenisms; for however closely, by a
mental synthesis, divers facts may be united into a new
fact or noögenism, the latter is obtained without losing
the former or elementary facts, which remain as Knowledge,
elements of Wisdom, to support the noögenism or
create others.</p>

<p class='c007'>We see then, that while Mind is crescive, Matter is not.
Matter is neither crescive nor decrescive. It may be
changed into divers forms, animal, vegetable, or mineral,
but it never can be varied in <em>quantity</em>. The six feet of
animated clay dies, it rots in the silent tomb; years pass
by. The hand of affection which protected the loathsome,
yet—for the once animating spirit’s sake—beloved, remains
is cold and rotted too. The sepulchre, so long forgotten
and deserted, again becomes of interest to the
brother of the hyæna and the resurrectionist—the antiquarian.
He, in his cool, business-like phraseology, opens
a barrow or exhumes a tomb, and finds—what? A pound
of dust! The sole visible remains of a gigantic hero or a
stalwart king. Yet is not one particle of that ancient
demigod perished. Every atom is, in some shape or other,
in the universe. Some atoms may “have gone a passage
through the guts of a beggar,” and so have nurtured
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>an other human form; some may have stopped a beer-barrel
and so</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Imperious Cæsar dead, and turned to clay,</div>
      <div class='line'>Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The theory of the metempsychosis is true of matter;
and as the ancient sages believed the soul to be material,
that theory, so far from being violently absurd (as we in
the pride of better knowledge are apt to term it), was
almost the only theory which the thinking and observant
mind could of itself elaborate. Hence the adoption of that
system by far-distant nations is no proof of inter-communication.
What the Brahmin in India found a natural
result of the doctrine of the materiality of the soul and its
consequent analogy to everything else material, the Druid
in Britain would arrive at with equal ease.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Mind is both crescive and decrescive; and it is
another peculiar property of Mind, that it is never stationary,—it
is always changing, increasing or decreasing.
This is an important consideration; a fearful responsibility
cast upon it. If the one talent (and God has so
benignly ordered it, that no sane, and therefore responsible,
mind is devoid of at least one talent,) is hid in a napkin,
the servant is condemned and his talent taken from him.
But if the talent is put out to use, it will increase and
grow, and make other talents, and the lord of that servant
will receive his own again with usury. For, having
endowed man with this crescive power, He justly demands
that power to be exercised and the mind to be enlarged
and expanded “by every one according to his several
ability,” so that He may reap the harvest which his well-rewarded
servants have gathered in, “reaping where He
hath not sown, and gathering where He hath not strewed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The very cause of this crescive power of mind is, that
the sum of the units aggregated by mind is greater than
the arithmetical sum of the units; and the cause of this
is, that facts, the elements of noögenisms, are not, like
chemical elements, lost in the fact compounded from them,
but retain likewise a separate, independent existence,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>capable of being again compounded into other noögenisms,
and still ever without losing their original forms.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will now be understood what is meant by two and
two making five, &amp;c.; and until a man is incontrovertibly
convinced of the possibility of this he will in vain multiply
facts. Facts must be added together, not for their arithmetical
product, which is Knowledge, but for their metaphysical
product, which is Wisdom. You will frequently
hear asked by utilitarians, what is the use (<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cui bono?</span></i>) of
such and such Knowledge? Remember that the use of all
Knowledge is to feed the mind and to generate Wisdom,
and you will always have this ready and sufficient reply,
“It is food for thought.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And here it may not be out of place to endeavour to
point out by an example the difference between knowledge
and wisdom, and at the same time elucidate more clearly
how the former is to be made subservient to and the
genetrix of the latter. We observe that a certain quartz-stone
is round. We have learnt two facts, the nature and
form of the stone. Now what is the value of those facts
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</span></i>? The recipience of them has increased our <em>knowledge</em>,
but is the mind strengthened or rendered one jot
<em>wiser</em>? We trow not. But as a key or foundation to an
aqueous <em>theory</em> of geology they are almost infinitely important.
The Cogitative Mind perceives that the round
stone must have once been an angular fragment broken off
from some rock of quartz, and asks, “How came it broken
off? and how came it round?” The answers are a whole
system of geology; nay, perhaps an entire system of the
universe a noögenism of the sublimest kind.<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c012'><sup>[25]</sup></a> Have not
these facts generated? Is it not clear that, if the physical
units had remained metaphysical units they would have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>been valueless? but being submitted to the powerful
energy of intense thought they become the parents of a
noögenism, into which “the angels desired to look,” and
at the first dawn of which, from the primæval chaos, “the
morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God
shouted for joy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Neither is this instance fanciful; for, while we write, it
reminds us that this identical simple fact,—a round pebble
on a common,—appeared to Paley to be one from which
the mind could evolve nothing, and therefore he contrasted
it with a watch, whose mechanism led the mind to theorize
on its causes and origin; whereas, a recent commentator
thereon justly observes, that the stone was as fertile a
source of cogitation and as able a guide “from Nature
up to Nature’s God,” as the watch was from itself to <em>its</em>
maker.</p>

<p class='c007'>From this example let us take warning, that facts be not
to us nothing more than round stones. Let us be careful
never to let our minds rest content with the mere accumulation
of facts, but ever strive to build them up into
something more useful and ennobling. Let us use them
as bricks—mere logs of burnt clay in themselves, but fit
to build glorious monuments of the sublime power of
human invention. Let us remember that Ideas are the
only things of real permanent value in this world; and
that, though we may store our brain with Facts till our
heads burst, unless those facts are to us only generators of
Ideas, we have not, and cannot acquire a Cogitative mind;
we may have Knowledge, but we have not Wisdom. A
wise man hath wisely said, that “the wise man is”—not
he who knoweth <em>things</em>, but—“he who knoweth the <em>interpretation</em>
of a thing” [<cite>Eccles.</cite> viii. 21]; and for this
purpose only it is that, “Wise men lay up knowledge”
[<cite>Prov.</cite> x. 14], for “Wisdom finds out knowledge of witty
inventions” [<cite>Prov.</cite> viii. 12].</p>

<p class='c007'>In order to effectually discipline the mind to attentive
study, and to save it from the strong temptation which is
offered to desultory reading, it is advisable for the adult
and partially educated student to form an hypothesis and
read up to it. To reverse, in fact, the Baconian principles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>of philosophy, and to study from hypothesis to facts, and
not from facts to hypothesis. This is, it is true, opposed
to modern philosophical principles, but properly modified
and carefully guarded against self-conceit and dogmatism,
it is almost the only proper and effective mode of study.
It is the ancient or Aristotelian mode; and though, when
refuted by Bacon, as a mode of “discovering the sciences,”
it had become shamefully abused and degenerate, it has
produced more great original thinkers than the modern.
Observe, that we recommend it only as a mode of <em>study</em>,
<em>i. e.</em>, of disciplining and exercising the mind, for beyond
the purpose of <em>training</em> it should not be pursued. It is
too dangerous to be prosecuted far, for the mind which has
long formed and nursed up a favourite hypothesis is unwilling
to abandon it, and is too apt to force all facts into
accordance with it, instead of modifying or abandoning it
as new facts arise.<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c012'><sup>[26]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>But the great advantages of this plan, as a training
process, would appear to be—1st. That the mind being
thus occupied with an hypothesis has always that to direct
its researches in a settled, uniform, and definite course.
2nd. That every new fact accumulated is immediately
compared with the hypothesis, and is incorporated or
written off as <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">contra</span></i>, after this mental exercise, as occasion
may require. Thus no fact ever comes into the mind
without being subjected to thought and giving exercise to
the important faculty of comparison. And this process of
comparing, to which every fact must be subjected, will not
only impress the fact and its comparatives on the memory,
but will powerfully tend to exercise and strengthen the
Cogitative powers; for there is no operation of mind which
more actively calls into energy all the faculties at once
than comparing, because to compare two things fairly we
must (so to speak) know the length, breadth, depth,
density and powers of each. 3rd. A steady habit of
reading is acquired; we read with a definite aim—the
establishment or refutation (we ought not to care which)
of our hypothesis, and, however wide and discursive our
reading, there is little danger of its becoming desultory—that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>curse and bane of modern mind. The Baconian process
of accumulating facts before hypothesising, almost
demands desultory reading, for the mind sees no fixed end
towards which it shall arrive; it is not permitted to guess
what may be the result of its studies, and hence too often
loses all interest in them, and remains content with the
barren accumulation of things.</p>

<p class='c007'>What we would suggest may be thus illustrated: Let a
man, intending to study history, first adopt an hypothesis—of
course he must have some pre-knowledge. It matters
not what the hypothesis, so that it is likely to involve a
very wide field of inquiry. If he contemplate primæval
history, let him adopt some such proposition as this,
“Whether we can infer from the institutions of mankind
that they all spring from one common ancestor?” Or
this, “Whether any nation whose national records have
been preserved were the first owners of the soil?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Is it not obvious, that with some such proposition before
the mind it will take much more interest in and more
steadily direct its studies, and that facts will be more
easily remembered, from their bearing on the hypothesis,
than if merely received as naked, isolated units?</p>

<p class='c007'>The only precautions to be taken are, not to be too
strongly wedded to either side of our hypothesis, nor to
sit down too soon satisfied that it is proved or disproved,
nor to set up for teachers and discoverers, while we are
only learners and making discoveries.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will be seen hereafter that, notwithstanding what has
been said, we differ not at all from Bacon himself; we
differ only from his pseudo-disciples, who have no more in
common with his enlarged views of the uses of science
than the schools had with Aristotle, or the New Academy
with Plato. Nevertheless, we well know that we shall be
well abused by these disciples as an impugner of Bacon,
and as a heretic to his philosophy, just as your pious
people condemn as an infidel or atheist every one who
denies any dogma which their wild enthusiasm has grafted
on the Bible. It is not in religion alone that bigotry is to
be found.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bacon himself pursued the mode of study which we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>suggest. At fifteen he formed an hypothesis, and devoted
his whole life to its elucidation. The hypothesis round
which, as a centre, he gathered every fact within his
reach was this: Whether or not the Aristotelian was the
best mode of cultivating the mind, and of discovering the
sciences?</p>

<p class='c007'>He seems at first to have been disposed to think that it
was neither; but the conclusion to which he finally came,
after many years of close thought and arduous study, was,
that it was the best mode of cultivating the mind, but the
worst mode of discovering the sciences. He did not soon
sit down satisfied that he was right, and set up for a dogmatic
teacher of his new philosophy. He waited patiently
for any new light which years and experience might throw
upon it, either bringing out more brightly its beauties or
disclosing more satisfactorily its errors. Once in each
year he reviewed it and tested it by the new facts which
he had gleaned during the year’s studies. Once in each
year, for twelve long years, he wrote out with his own
hand, altering, condensing and verifying his <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Novum
Organum</span></cite> before he published it.</p>

<p class='c007'>So much stress has, notwithstanding this illustrious
example of the master, been laid, ever since the publication
of the Baconian or inductive philosophy, upon the
bare accumulation of facts, and so much has been written
against generalizing and hypothesizing, that it may be as
well, before quitting the subject, to point out wherein the
disciples of Bacon have neglected the precepts of their
master; and to inquire whether this neglect, and the only
<em>partial</em> adoption of his teachings, have not contributed
greatly to the advancement of mere Knowledge at the
expense of true Wisdom, and thus been very important
causes of the degeneracy of modern mind.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bacon seems to have foreseen this effect of the exclusive
adoption of the experimental part of his philosophy—the
only part which men have yet had the courage to adopt—when
he said, “Our way of <em>discovering the sciences</em> almost
<em>levels the capacities</em> of men, and leaves little room for
excellence, as it performs all things by sure rules and
demonstrations, and therefore these discoveries of ours are,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>as we have often said, rather owing to felicity than to any
great talent, and are rather the production of time than of
genius.”<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c012'><sup>[27]</sup></a> It was for this reason that he so earnestly, as
we shall see hereafter, insisted against its use by young
and common minds, or as a means of mental cultivation.
And too truly has the prophetic caution been fulfilled!
Nevertheless, as it will be loudly denied that modern
mind is degenerate, it may be as well to ask how much we
are in anything, except physical science (facts, or what
Bacon calls “Experience”), in advance of our two hundred years’
dead ancestors. Array the names in our list of
Cogitatives, chronologically and analytically, or do so by
any list of great thinkers, and you will scarcely find a
proportion of one since 1700, to three who lived between
1550 and that date.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nevertheless, though there is this falling off in Wisdom,
how vast has been the accession of Knowledge. Bacon,
in his day, complained that the former, (Reason) had gone
on without the latter (Experience); so that, while mind
had attained the highest flights of which it seemed capable,
the arcana of nature were yet unexplored, and little or
nothing had been done to advance man’s physical welfare.
He said that, hitherto, reason and experience were as new
gifts of the gods:—the one laid on the back of a light bird,
the other on a dull ass, and that as yet they had not been
united. His object was to unite them; to this purpose
he devoted his gifted mind and strained his utmost energies.
Yet if he were living now he would be compelled to make
the same complaint, with this variation however, that
men have abandoned the burden of the bird, and have
loaded themselves with that of the ass.</p>

<p class='c007'>While then we admit the rapid advancement of Knowledge,
let us pause a moment and inquire if it is not a
proof of the degeneracy of mind and the decay of Wisdom,
that, in that which is purely mental or dependent on mind,
we have no names of equal note with the names of those
who lived before the exclusive adoption of the experimental
part of the Baconian philosophy. Where is the name in
poetry to set against Shakspere and Milton; in metaphysics
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>to match with Locke, Hobbes, &amp;c.; in deduction
from facts and generalization with Bacon, Newton, Halley,
&amp;c.; in theology, with the hundreds of names which yet
eclipse all modern commentators? It may perhaps be
said in reply, if we have not such great minds, we have a
larger number of thinkers of lesser magnitude. This is
doubtful. Time has obliterated the swarms of lesser fry
who, like their congeners of the nineteenth century, lived
their day and gained a temporary fame in the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries. But further, it is easy to be a
triton among minnows. It is as easy now-a-days to set
up for a literary character and “write a book” without an
idea, as it is for an insolvent man to pass for a rich one
and live sumptuously on borrowed capital and paper
money. Our thousands of authors are but the minnows
which sport in the shallow brooks and live their little day
in glorious self-gratulation on the laudations of their
brother minnows; but if they happen to get out into the
deep strong waters, and a triton turns his stern eye upon
them—pop—they turn their tails<a id='t73'></a> round, dive to the
bottom and are seen no more. Thus it was with our
novelists; they shone and blazed away—happy, glorious
book-wrights—till the triton Scott came athwart their
path, and straightway they were gone. And surely,
surely, we now again want another Scott to demolish the
rapidly increasing tribe of cachinnators, who appear to
deem that the proper end of light literature is just to raise
a temporary laugh and be forgotten. Heaven send us
salvation from more Jerrolds, à Beckets and the whole
tribe of ephemeral laughing-stocks! It is the same in
other and more important departments of literature. Our
historians are mere compilers of old letters; we fly to
Germany for historical criticism and acute generalizations
from facts, contenting ourselves with laboriously picking
up a few obscure facts for the use of our more deeply-thinking
neighbours; who are treading in the paths which
our own sages trod two hundred and fifty years ago, because
they have not yet placed the exact sciences at the
head of intellectual pursuits, and abandoned thought for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>mechanisms, generalizations from facts for the barren
accumulation of facts.</p>

<p class='c007'>The complaint of Lord Bacon is truer now than it was
in his time: “If a man turn his eyes to libraries, he may
perhaps be surprised at the immense variety of books he
finds; but upon examining and diligently weighing their
matters and contents, he will be struck with amazement
on the other side; and after finding no end of repetitions,
but that men continually treat and speak the same things
over and over again, fall from admiration of the variety
into a wonder at the want and scantiness of those things
which have hitherto detained and possessed the minds of
men.” Unhappily his system, by the universal and
indiscriminate adoption of only its lower and material
offices to the exclusion of those higher ends which he
contemplated from it, and by its being used as a mode of
cultivating the mind, as well as a means of discovering the
sciences, has rather strengthened than weakened the
justice of these censures. Our Augustan age of thought
is still that of Elizabeth and James I.; the latter part of
the sixteenth, and the early part of the seventeenth
centuries still outshine the nineteenth in loftiness of
thought and solidity of learning; yet we complacently
boast of our progress, because we rattle through the fields
of learning at ten times the speed of our ancestors, as we
do over our railway-sected country, gleaning about as little
information of the one as of the other. We dash through
the deep cuttings and dark tunnels of literature at railway
speed, taking assertions for facts, and empty declamation
and tawdry immorality for sense and religion; and then,
like the nervous lady who rides through a railway tunnel
without fainting, congratulate ourselves on having accomplished
some gigantic feat; though we have learnt just as
much about the subject of our studies as she has of the
construction of the tunnel; but having, like her, fretted
and fumed for a few minutes at some dark difficulty, we
unite with her in thinking ourselves very valiant and
clever people.</p>

<p class='c007'>We avail ourselves of the roads and paths which others
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>have made, and never stop to examine their solidity or
foundations, or the principles on which they are constructed.
We lose the habits of deep investigation and
close thinking by a long and entire reliance on others,
and our minds become dissipated, and a prey to all the
silly novelties which spring like ephemera from the almost
stagnant pools of modern brains.</p>

<p class='c007'>This mental dissipation and its concomitant evil, reading
for the purpose of killing time,—with far more baneful
effects than never reading at all, but relying merely
on our own serious excogitations,—are curses from which
we ought earnestly to endeavour to save ourselves. This
we can only do by sternly exercising the mind in settled
definite habits of thought, by placing before it a determinate
aim and end to its cogitations. It must know
beforehand whither it is tending, so that, as it proceeds,
it may note its progress, and be able to judge whether it
is advancing or receding. It would be as absurd for a
man to start on a journey without knowing whither he
was going, but to be continually trying first one road and
then another, in hopes it would bring him somewhere,
as it is for a student to sit down to study without any
definite purpose or view before him. True, the traveller
might pick up many facts and get some knowledge in his
desultory course, and so might the student; but neither
would be advanced on his journey or have gained any
true wisdom. Yet this is the course of modern study.
Loose, desultory reading: a vague acquisition of unconnected
facts is alone aimed at. “Witness the transactions
of our scientific bodies—a huge undigestive mass of valuable
facts; mere raw materials, knowledge-bricks, which
no one has dared yet to generalize or build up into a harmonious
and well-proportioned temple of wisdom.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Run your memory over the records of the British Association
for the Advancement of Science, and what do you
find? Is it not exactly the same as that which the witty
author of “Hudibras” castigated two hundred years ago,
in his satire on the Royal Society,—a mere chronicle of
the feats of butterfly-hunters and fly-catchers? Is there
to be found in the eighteen years’ “Transactions” of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>hundreds of scientific men, whose combined knowledge is
many hundred times more extensive than that of the
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">savans</span></i> of any past age, a single attempt at a generalization
of their immense field of facts? Is there any effort
at what Solomon calls the “interpretation of things?”—at
gathering the “fruits” of the Baconian system? Are
they not only a barren addition to the mountain of facts
already accumulated? Alas! it is too true.</p>

<p class='c007'>Modern <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">savans</span></i> shrink from using the materials which,
for several centuries, thousands of laborious literary ants
have been collecting. Like the unhappy Psyche, doomed
by the inexorable Venus to arrange and sort into respective
heaps a confused mass of wheat, barley, rye, millet and
other kinds of grain, they sit down in despair of accomplishing
the apparently hopeless task. Frightened at the
gigantic labour, they not only fly from it themselves but
condemn every one who attempts to arrange systematically
the grains which, assorted, would afford valuable
seed for fresh crops of food, but which, while thus intermingled,
are utterly useless and unproductive. With an
insane determination <em>not</em> to see the work which it is the
duty imposed on the soul (Psyche) by the prolific powers
of nature (Venus) to accomplish, they go on adding to the
heterogeneous heap, and endeavour, by loud and clamorous
applauses of those who are mere collectors like themselves,
to drown the voice of those who would incite them to the
enjoined and higher duty of assorting and arranging.</p>

<p class='c007'>Should any one, like the able but mistaken author of
the “Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation,” endeavour
to bring Thought to bear upon these dry bones and
make them live, to generalize and build up a system from
them, great is the outcry and terrible are the denunciations.
The modern Prometheus who would animate with the
celestial fire of forethought the clay which lies a dead and
useless mass at his feet, is clamourously damned by his
timid brethren the Epimethei, the after or past-thinkers;
and, unless he is endowed with more than mortal power,
he must submit to have his heart daily devoured by the
racking fiends—envy, hatred, malice, and all uncharitableness.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>One of the laborious ants of whom we have been speaking
asks, “For what do we read?” and complacently
answers, “To know <em>facts</em>.”<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c012'><sup>[28]</sup></a> Indeed! The highest
office of mind is to make itself a barren storehouse!
To us it appears, on the contrary, that we should read
and study generally, not to <em>know</em> facts, but to <em>be wise</em>
from facts, to make the head wiser and the heart better.
The mind is not to be considered as a mere granary and
barren receptacle of literary food, but rather as the
stomach which converts into a new substance—assimilating
good healthy flesh and blood—the heterogeneous
materials which are put into it. Another ant, of no mean
pretensions among his brethren, enthusiastically endeavours,
by promises of “literary glory,” to incite some of
them to pile up into one heap the confused materials they
have collected. “Let us see,” he says with childish glee,
“how much we’ve got! You John, and you Willy, and
you Bobby bring what you’ve collected! There pile it
up! Make a snow man; cut him eyes, and nose, and
mouth.” There he is with a pipe in his white lips.
Doesn’t he look sage, and grave, and solemn? Dance
round him, ye children; clap your hands and be merry.
Rejoice over your work while it lasts. The first warm
breath of spring will melt it away. It is no man, it
has no life, it is cold and dead. The snow, give it
what shape you will, is snow still. You have collected
much, but you have got nothing new out of
your collection. But lest it should be supposed that
we belie this celebrated ant—this collector of grain—we
will quote his own words: “Within the last two hundred
years (says Professor Playfair), or since Galileo and
Bacon taught us this great lesson, <em>we have been employed
in recording facts</em> in ten thousand several volumes. But
thus scattered, they lose so much of their value and importance,
that, in another age, we may hope some aspirant
after literary glory will perform the Herculean labour of
condensing the whole into (What?—a system of the universe?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>a better knowledge of nature? No!) <em>a volume!</em>”
A <em>volume!</em> that is to say, gather the scattered masses into
one heap as heterogeneous as the scattered masses; pile
up the snow, strewed over pathway and field, hedge and
ditch, into a snow man. That is the highest aspiration of
this Professor of divers learned societies. His grovelling
soul soars not to the hope that any new fact may be
extracted by mind from this vast heap of raw materials.
He knows not that, metaphysically, two and two make
five, and that without any other material additions, without
any more ant-collections, the heap may be made to
grow and swell, that the spirit of life may be breathed
into it, and that, wedded to mind, it may even become the
prolific parent of new facts of a far higher and more
enduring nature than any in his boasted volume. Facts,
which, having mind for one of their parents, will with
filial love pay back in tenfold blessings the life given
them; facts which will lead that parent to unravel the
mysterious secrets of nature, and enable her to behold the
wonderful arcana of its Holy of Holies.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is the purpose for which we should read, and this
the glorious end for which we should collect facts; instead
of merely contenting ourselves with being employed, as
Playfair too truly says we have been since the time of
Bacon, “in recording facts in ten thousand several volumes,”
with no higher aspiration than that some laborious stable-cleaner
may sweep them up, hay and straw, corn and rubbish,
into one vast heap.</p>

<p class='c007'>Since this was written, it pleases us to see that the
able author of “Vestiges of the Natural History of
Creation” has in his “Explanations” spoken to the same
effect and added another instance of the low estimate
formed by modern scientific minds of the uses of facts.
“From year to year and from age to age we see scientific
men at work, adding, no doubt, much to the known,
and advancing many important interests, but at the same
time doing little for the establishment of comprehensive
views of nature. Experiments, in however narrow a
walk, facts, of whatever minuteness, make reputations in
scientific societies. All beyond is regarded with suspicion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>find distrust. The consequence is, that <em>philosophy</em>, as it
exists among us, <em>does nothing to raise its votaries above the
common ideas of their time</em>. Let me call upon the reader
to bring to his remembrance the impressions which have
been usually made upon him by the transactions of learned
societies, and the pursuits of individual men of science.
Did he not always feel that while there was laudable industry
and zeal there was also an intellectual timidity, rendering
all the results philosophically barren?</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps a more lively illustration of their deficiency
in the <em>life and soul of nature-seeking</em> could not be presented
than in the view which Sir John Herschel gives of the
uses of science, in a Treatise reputed as one of the most
philosophical ever produced in our country. These uses,
according to the learned knight, are strictly material—it
might be said sordid—namely, ‘to show us how to avoid
attempting impossibilities, to secure us from important mistakes,
in attempting what is in itself possible by means
either inadequate or actually opposed to the end in view;
to enable us to accomplish our ends in the easiest, shortest
and most economical and most effectual manner; to induce
us to attempt and enable us to accomplish, objects which,
but for such knowledge, we should never have thought of
undertaking.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“Such results, it will be felt, may occasionally be of
importance in saving a country gentleman from a hopeless
mining speculation, or in adding to the powers and profits
of an iron-foundry or a cotton-mill, but nothing more.
When the awakened and craving mind asks what science
can do for us in explaining the great ends of the author of
nature, and our relations to Him, to good and evil, to life
and to eternity, the man of science turns to his collection
of shells or butterflies, to his electric machine or his retort,
and is mute as a child who, sporting on the beach, is asked
what lands lie beyond the great ocean which stretches
before him.”<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c012'><sup>[29]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>This is unhappily too true a picture of modern science.
Every effort is made in scientific works to impress the
material and sordid money-getting uses of science as its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>only true end, and the highest relation which it bears to
humanity. Read any tract on the uses of geology, and is
there a word of high hope that the addition which recent
discoveries in this department have made to knowledge
will assist in raising and elevating the mind, or throw any
new light upon the mysteries of nature?</p>

<p class='c007'>Not a word: but it is carefully detailed how an acquaintance
with the order of stratified rocks will facilitate the
discovery of minerals, or the boring of Artesian wells.</p>

<p class='c007'>Are the uses of astronomy dwelt upon, we are taught
that it enables the seaman to navigate trackless seas for
commerce or for war. Are the purposes of chemistry
detailed, we learn that it is fertile in assisting the manufacturer
to cheapen his goods, and undersell his less experienced
neighbour.</p>

<p class='c007'>And are we to believe that for these base uses it will be
given to man to penetrate the wonders of the universe, and
read the unexplained mystery of its creation? Surely not.
No, verily, we must raise our souls far above these debasing
cares, before the great and beneficent <span class='sc'>God</span> will permit us
to understand His sublime works. We must come to the
task with clean hands, with pure, holy, unsullied minds,
with humble, but high aspirations, with the submission of
little children, but with the elevation of pure wisdom.</p>

<p class='c007'>Is it possible that mind can progress at all, if it is for
ever fixed on the earth, grovelling after barren facts and
never lifted up to heaven, nor exercised in contemplation
of the discoveries it has accumulated? Is it possible that
the mind can ever be wise which believes that it must
study for facts, and not to ‘weigh and consider?’ Must
not the former for ever remain the mere basket of the rag-and-bone
collector? the receptacle and dead vehicle of
material things? Is it not better that the mind should be
exercised, like ‘a light bird,’ in the wildest and most visionary
dreams, than be reduced to such a ‘dull ass,’ or dead
entity? If the student would avoid the latter, he must
abandon the mere accumulation of facts for the comparing
and weighing of evidence, the calm looking for results, and
the deliberate generalization from the facts collected by the
fact-collectors; the rag-and-bone-pickers, the hewers of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>wood and drawers of water of the human race. Nevertheless
despise them not; they fill their allotted station in the
world; they are as necessary to the thinkers as the different
ranks in society are to each other. Bear in mind that
Bacon never intended his system for <em>students</em>, or to be used
as a mental exercise. He only proposed it as a means,
(and confessedly the only true means) of ‘discovering the
sciences,’ and not as a mode of ‘cultivating’ the mind. It
was to be the exercise of the experienced and completely
cultivated mind only, ‘of the man of riper years, sound in
his senses, and of a clear, unbiassed mind.’<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c012'><sup>[30]</sup></a> He foresaw
and cautioned against its abuse by ‘vulgar minds.’ And
in the sense used by him all young and learning minds are
vulgar (common) minds. The specialities which must distinguish
them from the common herd, are as yet unknown
and hidden beneath the crust of inexperienced ignorance.</p>

<p class='c007'>He himself earnestly prays that his own and the Aristotelian
system may live together, and go hand in hand, the
latter to cultivate the mind, the former to discover facts.
His words so long forgotten and unheeded by his disciples
are: “Let there be therefore, by joint consent, two fountains,
or dispensations of doctrine, and two tribes of Philosophers,
by no means enemies or strangers, but confederates
and mutual auxiliaries to each other; and let there
<em>be one method of</em> <span class='fss'>CULTIVATING</span>, and <em>another of</em> <span class='fss'>DISCOVERING</span>
the sciences. Nor is ours very obvious, <em>and to be taken
at once</em>, nor tempting to the understanding, nor <em>suited to
vulgar capacities</em>, but solely rests upon its utility and effects”
(<em>i. e.</em> upon the way in which it is used and the results which
proceed from it). “But no one, sure, can suspect, that we
desire to destroy and demolish the philosophy, the arts,
and the sciences at present in use; for, <em>on the contrary, we
embrace their use</em>, and willingly pay them all due honour
and observance. For we openly declare that the things
we offer, are not very conducive to these purposes (mental
exercises), as they cannot be brought down to vulgar capacities,
otherwise than by effects and works.”<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c012'><sup>[31]</sup></a> Therefore
in advocating the retention of the Aristotelian mode of
thinking for students, we do but follow in the footsteps of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>his great opponent; who yet opposed only when that
ancient philosophy was carried beyond, and out of its proper
department—the cultivation of the powers of thought,
into the discovery of the sciences.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The two faculties of reason and experience,” says
Bacon, “should be properly joined and coupled together.”
Reason without experience (facts) he compares to a light
bird; Experience, without reason to a dull ass. It is
better to be the bird than the ass; it is best to be
neither, and yet both. It is only by joining experience
with reason that the “sober certainty” of the quadruped
can be coupled with the “waking bliss,” the ecstatic
heavenward flight, of the light and joyous bird. If, like
Bacon, we were to endeavour to read the fable of the
Sphinx, we would say that it represents the wise mind,
which has united reason and experience into a beautiful
form; comprehendible by man, but most hard to be comprehended.
Its human head portrays that to intellectual
man alone it is given to join together its other forms, the
wings of a bird, reason; and the body of a quadruped,
experience. It is beautiful, for such union is the perfection
of wisdom, and ‘O how comely is wisdom!’ It
is cruel, for many lives must be sacrificed ’ere it can be
discovered, or the problem of its nature be solved.</p>

<p class='c007'>Far different from the master himself, who saw in his
philosophy the attainment of high and holy purposes,
his pseudo-disciples shrink not from avowing that the
material uses of philosophy are of higher import than
the metaphysical. And it is because writers of no mean
powers have, while setting themselves up as encomiasts
and expounders of Baconism, utterly lost sight of the
higher and godlike purposes which Bacon hoped to see
his system promote, and have exalted only the simply
mean and sordid uses, which, as tending to man’s temporal
comforts, Bacon’s large heart also desired to increase, that
we have so far enlarged our observations hereon; and
shall, ere we conclude, set a few extracts from these
modern views of Baconism in opposition to those of Bacon
himself. From these we shall see that, with regard to
their views of the objects of philosophy, no two systems
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>can be more opposed than that of Bacon himself, and that
of the modern utilitarians, who dare to dub themselves
his disciples. The latter seek in science nothing higher
than base utilitarianism, thus elevating the body at the
expense of the soul; the former sought utilitarianism in
company with the attainment of pure truth and the investigation
of the hidden secrets of nature, thus elevating
both soul and body.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was the fault of the ancient philosophy that it
endeavoured to elevate the soul at the expense of the
body, and to separate that which God has joined together;
it is equally the fault—but a far more baneful one—of
modern utilitarianism that it endeavours to elevate the
body above the soul, and treats the comfort of the former
as of far higher importance than the exaltation of the
latter.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bacon alone, truly wise, sought the well-being of both;
and he alone pointed out that the well-being of both lay
in the same path, and might be prosecuted simultaneously.
While the ancient philosophy feared to defile the soul by
contact with what was falsely called the base in nature,
and the utilitarian dreads to have his sordid soul elevated
above the same operations,—which he equally terms base,
yet loves to degrade himself to—Bacon acknowledged
nothing base in nature, and feared not to study her
simplest and meanest operations in the pursuit of truth.
He knew that whatever advances the soul makes in knowledge
and wisdom, must be made through and by means
of the body; therefore, the latter was not to be despised,
but by all possible ways and means to be made the efficient
handmaid of the former. He knew that though the eye
sees not, and the ear hears not, yet that the soul, in this
mortal state, could neither see nor hear without them, and
that by increasing their fact-transmitting powers, he was
developing the fact-generating powers of the mind.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was for this reason that he contemned not to give
his mind to experience, to making telescopes and ear-trumpets;
but nevertheless he did not regard them as
the ultimate and sole end and aim of his philosophy. His
views of the ends of philosophy were, as we shall presently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>see, to the full as high and lofty as those of Plato and the
Grecian philosophers; he only sought to arrive at those
ends by means different from those which they pursued.
They both sought the same objects—Truth, and the
discovery of the secrets of nature; but while the one
foolishly did this by opposing nature, and acting in contradiction
to her mandates, the other did it by following
her patiently through all her devious windings.</p>

<p class='c007'>The modern Baconian school of utilitarians errs in stopping
half-way, and in mistaking what Bacon merely
deemed media, for the ultimate ends of his philosophy.
Whirled along by a steam-engine, informed by a telegraph,
freed from pain by chloroform, the utilitarian deems suchlike
products of the inductive philosophy, to be the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">summum
bonum</span></i> of its founder; forgetful that he considered such
to be but the means to a higher end, and has said that
“the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">summum bonum</span></i> of human nature is the possession
of Truth, for this is a heaven upon earth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But the better to understand this, let us contrast
modern Baconism with Bacon,—“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ab uno disce omnes</span>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. T. B. Macaulay, a masterly and deservedly popular
writer, has undertaken to give a more correct analysis
of the objects of Baconism than is usually entertained;
but as it happens to be only an analysis of modern
utilitarianism, we will avail ourselves of it as a contrast
with Bacon’s own aspirations of the benefits to be derived
from his system.<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c012'><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Hear the utilitarian’s version of Baconism in contrast
with the ancient philosophy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Plato, after speaking slightly of the convenience of
arithmetic in the ordinary transactions of life, as to make
men shop-keepers or pedlars, passes to what he considers
as a far more important advantage. It habituates the
mind, he tells us, to the contemplation of <em>pure truth</em>,
and raises us above the material universe; and he advises
his disciples to this study, in order that they may learn to
fix their minds on the <em>immutable essences of things</em>. Bacon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>on the other hand, valued this branch of knowledge <em>only</em>
on account of its uses with reference to the visible and
tangible world.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of mathematics, Plato says the real use is to lead men
to the knowledge of abstract <em>essential, eternal truth</em>. Bacon
valued mathematics chiefly, if not solely, on account of
those uses which Plato deemed so base—its application
to mechanics, &amp;c. If Bacon erred here, we must acknowledge
that we greatly prefer his error to the opposite
error of Plato.</p>

<p class='c007'>“To sum up the whole,” says this eulogist of what
he deems Baconism against the ancient philosophy as
explained by Plato, “we should say that the aim of the
Platonic philosophy was to exalt man into a god. The
aim of the Baconian philosophy, was to provide man with
what he requires, while he continues to be man, and to
supply his vulgar wants. The former aim was noble; but
the latter was attainable. Plato drew a good bow, but he
aimed at the stars; therefore the shot was thrown away.
Bacon fixed his eye on a mark, which was placed on <em>the
earth</em>, and within bow-shot, and hit it in the white.”<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c012'><sup>[33]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>If this were a true picture of Bacon’s mind, how sad,
and low, and grovelling, must it have been. Accustomed
to grieve that he suffered his soul to be polluted by
contact with the world, and bowed his heart beneath the
love of ill-gotten gold, we have yet found consolation in
the thought that the man and the philosopher were two;
and that we might dwell with rapture on the latter, take
him to our heart, and make him our mind’s companion
without defiling ourselves with the former. But if this
were a true picture of the philosopher, we must turn
from him with disgust, as one whose soul was so imbued
with the low and sordid, that no intellectual powers, how
sublime soever, could elevate it above what was low and
sordid, mean and base.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sick at heart and disgusted with humanity, we must
turn with joy to him who sought “to exalt man into a
god,” who urged us “to the contemplation of pure truth,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>“to fix our minds on the immutable essences of things,”
and “the knowledge of the abstract, essential, eternal
truth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But thank God, it is not a true picture of Bacon’s
mind and purpose in revealing to the world a new
philosophy.</p>

<p class='c007'>At most it is but one half the picture, and that the
lower half. It exhibits the mouth only, the vehicle of the
material things which sustain the body. Yet nevertheless
not to be despised; for without it the body could not live,
and without the body the mind could have no communion
with mortal minds, and as to them must be dead also.
But it entirely cuts off and conceals the upper half of the
man; the skull, the seat of mind, the residence of that
God-inspired particle, which alone ennobles and makes
valuable the whole body.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is true that Bacon hoped by his philosophy to supply
man’s vulgar wants, and to make his sojourn here as easy
and comfortable as was possible; but he sought this only
as a necessary and blessed accident by the way, and not as
the end of his new learning.</p>

<p class='c007'>While he laboured to benefit mankind as mortal man,
he also strove to elevate him as an immortal soul; mindful
of the origin which, he dared, like Plato, to hope to exalt
man into a god, by leading the divine spirit, breathed into
him when he was made in the image of God, to a contemplation
and discovery of the secrets of the Great Artificer.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a favourite text of Bacon’s, “It is the glory of
God to conceal a matter; it is the glory of the King (a
man) to find it out.” [<cite>Prov.</cite> xxv. 2.]</p>

<p class='c007'>Was not this very much like placing man almost on a
parity with God, and exalting him into a god? And
again, even misquoting to suit his lofty notions of man’s
capabilities: “The spirit of man is as the lamp of God,
wherewith He searches every secret.”<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c012'><sup>[34]</sup></a> [<cite>Prov.</cite> xx. 27.]
Surely, too, the aim of him who describes the sole end of
his philosophy in the following words, is not different from
that of him who urges his disciples “to fix their minds on
the contemplation of the immutable essences of things.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>“The end of our foundation is the knowledge of causes,
and secret motions of things, and the enlarging the
bounds of human empire to the effecting of all things
possible.”<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c012'><sup>[35]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Neither does he differ at all from the philosophy of the
Academy in his appreciation of pure truth. “Truth,
which only doth judge itself, teacheth that the inquiry of
Truth, which is the love-making or wooing of it; the
knowledge of Truth, which is the presence of it; and the
belief of Truth, which is the enjoying of it—<em>is the sovereign
good of human nature</em>. The poet saith excellently
well: ‘It is a pleasure to stand upon the shore, and to see
ships tossed upon the sea; a pleasure to stand in the window
of a castle, and to see a battle and the adventures
thereof below; but no pleasure is comparable to the
standing upon the vantage-ground of Truth, and to see
the errors and wanderings, and mist and tempests in the
sea below;’<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c012'><sup>[36]</sup></a> so always that this prospect be with pity, and
not with swelling or pride. Certainly it is heaven upon
earth to have a man’s mind move in charity, rest in providence,
and turn upon the poles of Truth.”<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c012'><sup>[37]</sup></a> Is this the
language of one who had no higher aim than “to supply
man’s vulgar wants, and whose eye was ever on a mark
which was placed on earth and within bow-shot?” No!
long since must Bacon have been forgotten, if his
philosophy had had no higher end than that which modern
utilitarianism deems its proudest boast.</p>

<p class='c007'>One more extract will suffice to evince, that in promoting
the proper study of his favourite science, Natural
Philosophy, he had far higher views than mere utilitarianism;
though this was to be regarded by the way and as
an accident of no mean importance. “All knowledge,
and especially that of natural philosophy, tendeth highly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>to the glory of God in His power, providence and benefits
appearing and engraven in His works, which without this
knowledge are beheld but as through a veil, for if the
heavens in the body of them do declare the glory of God
to the eye, much more do they in the rule and decrees of
them declare it to the understanding.”<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c012'><sup>[38]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>An apology is needed for this long episode on Bacon,
and our apology must be an anxious desire to direct the
student back from the false school of Baconism to the
master himself. Leave the Macaulays, the Herschels and
the Playfairs to the work—and an important and useful
work it is—for which they are fitted; but do you endeavour
so to mind earthly things that you forget not heavenly
things.<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c012'><sup>[39]</sup></a> We say not, as did the ancient philosophers,
disregard earthly things; but, while attending to them,
forget not the heavenly, as the utilitarians do. Neither
would it have been necessary to have entered so fully into
the matter had we not been aware that of the thousands
who pretend to tread in the steps of Bacon, not above one
or two have ever read his more important works, but take
their notions of his philosophy from such crude and partial
views as the merest utilitarians choose to enunciate as
Baconian.</p>

<p class='c007'>We require no other proof of the degeneracy of modern
mind from the close habits of intense thought which distinguished
the predecessors and cotemporaries of Bacon,
than the melancholy fact, that while the <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Novum Organum</span></cite>
and <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Augmentis</span></cite> were, in the author’s time, eagerly read by
every one pretending to a liberal education, and at once
elevated him to a high rank among literary men, they are
scarcely ever opened in the present day, “and though
much talked of are but little read. They have produced,
indeed, a vast effect on the opinions of mankind, but they
have produced it through the operation of intermediate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>agents.”<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c012'><sup>[40]</sup></a> Of these intermediate agents we have given a
few specimens; and as long as the world submits to receive
their version of Baconism, so long will Baconism elevate
Knowledge at the expense of True Wisdom. Let men
return to Bacon, and take <em>all</em> that he teaches instead of
part—the inferior part—and there will be nothing for
Wisdom or Knowledge to fear.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VI.<br /> <span class='large'>OF THE JEWISH NOSE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Class</span> IV.—<span class='sc'>The Jewish</span>, or Hawk Nose, is very convex, and preserves
its convexity like a bow, throughout the whole length from
the eyes to the tip. It is thin and sharp.</p>

<p class='c017'>It indicates considerable Shrewdness in worldly matters; and deep
insight into character, and facility of turning that insight to profitable
account.</p>
<p class='c006'>This is a good, useful, practical Nose, very able to carry
its owner successfully through the world, that is as success
is now-a-days measured, by weight of purse; nevertheless
it will not elevate him to any very exalted pitch of intellectuality.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is called the Jewish Nose in conformity with long-established
nomenclature, and is, perhaps more frequent
among the Jews than among most other nations resident
in Europe. It is, however a fallacy to suppose that the
peculiar physiognomy called Jewish is confined to the
Jews, or even exclusively characteristic of them. It is in
fact a form of profile common to all the inhabitants of
Syria; and Sir G. Wilkinson has proved in his erudite
work on Ancient Egypt, that the nations represented in
the Egyptian sculptures with this cast of countenance are
not always intended for Jews, as was at one time supposed,
but for Syrians. Moreover, this form of countenance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>is to this day, the usual one among the Arabs of
that part of the world. This Nose should therefore more
properly be called the Syrian Nose.</p>

<p class='c007'>This fact enables us to extend our illustrations, by
adducing divers national proofs of the correctness of the
indications ascribed to this Nose.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have said that it is a good, useful, practical Nose,
<em>i. e.</em> a good money-getting Nose, a good commercial Nose,
and perhaps the latter term would be an apt secondary
designation for it. Hence, those nations which have been
most largely gifted with it, have been always celebrated
for their commercial success.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Phœnicians were Syrians, and the portraits which
we have of these people on the Egyptian sculptures, as
read by Sir G. Wilkinson, all exhibit this form of Nose.
It is unnecessary to enlarge on the very early commercial
activity of this nation, on its extensive traffic, its flourishing
colonies, and its mighty fleets. While the rest of the
world was in barbarism, or kept their low civilization carefully
locked up within their own dominions, the Phœnicians
were spreading arts and letters among the barbarous
nations of Europe, and carrying civilization forward on its
destined course towards the West. And the incentive to
this and the means whereby it was effected were the same
as those which now animate modern Tyre to promote the
same Westward tendency of civilization. What Phœnicia, a
little western corner of Asia, did for Europe, England, a little
western corner of Europe, has done and is doing for lands still
further West—America and Austral-Asia; destined to be
in their turns the seats of a still progressive civilization,
until every part of the earth shall have been in succession
blessed with a civilization, if not always equal in degree,
always adequate to its age, requirements, and capacity.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then when the whole circle shall have been accomplished—and
of which more than two-thirds have been
already passed over—when civilization in Austral-Asia
shall touch the confines of its original starting point, the
Eastern shores of India, the consummation of all things
shall be at hand; the purpose for which the earth was
created, and for which millions of years have been slowly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>surely, and silently beautifying, storing, and adapting it,
until it is like “the Garden of the Lord,” shall have been
fulfilled; and the whole of this beautiful system shall
vanish away like a breath, yet leave no vacuity, no defect,
in the vast and mighty universe, whose limits utterly
transcend our notions of time and space.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two-thirds of this circle have been already passed over;
the remaining third is rapidly running out: we already
stand half-way between the beginning and the end of this
third part; nay, we are nearer the end than the beginning,
we see more clearly and apprehend more closely
the day when Austral-Asia shall be the seat of civilization
and Christianity, than we do the day when those blessings
seventeen hundred years ago, first landed on our shores;
we feel more affinity for, and more sympathy with, the
latter age than with the former, and we may be assured
that we do this because we are much nearer in Time to
the one than to the other.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is an awful contemplation; we cannot but feel that
there is an extra responsibility cast upon us upon whom
literally “the ends of the world are come,” and that it
concerns us more than all who have gone before to be up
and be doing; to take heed that while civilization is progressing
geographically, it is also progressing in power
and character; for upon the extent and nature of the
Knowledge which we transmit, depend in a great degree
the extent and nature of the Knowledge which shall ever
reign on the earth.</p>

<p class='c007'>Theologically considered, the subject is infinitely more
awful and important; and the mind cannot contemplate
without fear and trembling, what may be the consequences
if we, instead of a pure and perfect, transmit to the few
generations yet to subsist on the earth, an impure and
imperfect, Christianity.</p>

<p class='c007'>But to return to our more immediate subject. The
Jews have always been celebrated for shrewdness in commercial
affairs. Though the peculiarities of their religion
prevented them from taking a leading part in the general
commercial business of the ancient world, yet among themselves
trade always flourished; and in the present age of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>the world, the Jews were in all countries the first revivers
of commerce after the stagnation occasioned by the irruptions
of the northern hordes, and in many nations are still
almost the only traders.</p>

<p class='c007'>It does not always follow, however, that the love and
capacity for getting money is accompanied by a sordid
disinclination to part with it. Numerous instances occur
of persons who shrewdly bargain for pence, but liberally
give away pounds. As we may seem to have inferred
that the former is a Jewish habit, it is right, and we are
happy to be able to say, that some instances of princely
liberality among modern Jews, afford lessons which Christians
would do well to take.</p>

<p class='c007'>No very exalted intellectuality is to be looked for from
the Syrian Nose. Its sphere of action is widely different
from that of mental exertion for the mere pleasure
thence derivable. Hence, we find, that notwithstanding
the free intercourse which the Phœnicians permitted
with all nations, the ancient sages rarely travelled
to Phœnicia for learning. If they went there, they went
like Solomon, to traffic. They sought learning among the
Chaldeans, the Indians, and the Egyptians, but seldom
touched in their course on the more accessible shores of
Phœnicia. The Phœnicians have had the reputation of
being the inventors of letters because they introduced them
into Europe; but they were the mere carriers of them for
commercial purposes, not the inventors.</p>

<p class='c007'>Though some attempts have been lately made to prove
that the Hebrew nation has furnished more learned men
than any other, the attempts are an utter failure.</p>

<p class='c007'>Curious wranglers, ingenious cabalists, fine splitters of
hairs, shrewd perverters of texts, sharp detectors of discrepancies,
clever concocters of analogies, finders of mysteries
in a sunbeam, constitute the mass of modern<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c012'><sup>[41]</sup></a> Jewish
scholars. What is the Talmud, the Mishna, the Gemara,
or any of their comments thereon, or on Scripture, but
mere puerile exercises of wit; sometimes ingenious, but
always reckless of truth, decency, or common sense? We
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>search in vain, as far as our knowledge of those works
extends, and all who have studied them corroborate our
opinion, for any expanded views, any comprehensive ideas
or extensive learning. Neither does their ancient history
furnish any but inspired names, to class among the world’s
sages.</p>

<p class='c007'>Education is however rapidly extending among the
Jews. For the first time since they ceased to be a nation
they appear to begin to feel the importance of raising
themselves to an equal intellectual rank with the citizens
among whom their lot is cast. This is the natural consequence
of the accordance to them of equal national privileges—a
still further extension of which, even to a seat in
the Legislature, would promote their further elevation in
the social scale.</p>

<p class='c007'>Numerous schools have recently been founded by them
for the education of their own people—both male and
female—in England and other European States. From these
the most beneficial results may be anticipated.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has always been found to be the greatest obstacle to
the spread of Christianity among a people who <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à priori</span></i> might
be supposed to be the most ready to receive it as a proof of
the truth and fulfilment of their own Scriptures, that they
know not these Scriptures; but are either immersed in the
grossest ignorance, or glean their religion from the Talmud
and the Mishna. It has been justly said, “The Jews
must be made Old Testament Jews before they can be
made Christians;” and this can only be done by education
among themselves creating a spontaneous spirit of inquiry
into their own literature, with an anxious desire to read
and comprehend the vast storehouse of Biblical treasure at
present almost unknown to the large majority of them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sources of our individual illustrations treating only
of those who have distinguished themselves in Literature
or History furnish only a few examples of the Jewish Nose.</p>

<p class='c019'>may serve, however, to illustrate and corroborate our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>theory. As to the last, the connection between his Nose
and the peculiar bias of his mind is obvious.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The founder of the Science of Political Economy”
must have possessed a natural attraction towards commercial
affairs; and it could only have been by a very
large share of acute observation and shrewd penetration
that he could have worked out the principles of so abstruse
a science, and made it acceptable to the mass of mankind.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was,” says one of his admirers, “one of the few,
but greatest, errors of Adam Smith, that he was too apt
to consider man as a mere <em>money-making</em> animal, who will
never hesitate to work provided he is well paid for it.
He does not consider that the desire of power and of
esteem are more powerful principles than the desire of
wealth.”</p>

<p>ADAM SMITH.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It is impossible to desire a description of his character
more exactly correspondent to the form of his Nose.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been much disputed among his biographers
whether <span class='sc'>Correggio</span> was rich or poor. Many anecdotes
are related which indicate his extreme poverty; while on
the other hand, numerous facts seem to prove that he must
at least have been in easy circumstances. He married a
lady of good fortune, and he was well appreciated in his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>own time, and received many valuable orders for paintings
from patrons of high rank and great liberality. It is however
undisputed that his disposition was penurious and
miserly, and this fact—indicated also by his unusually
well-developed hawk-nose—will serve to reconcile the
apparently contradictory assertions of his biographers.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_p095.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic004'>
<p>CORREGGIO.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It is probable that, like most misers, he was always
complaining of poverty, and even denied himself necessaries
which he could have well afforded. Those who
credited these complaints, recorded his poverty and
lamented over it with mistaken kindness; while others,
who more critically considered his actual means, would
better appreciate them and reveal the true state of the
case. There is an anecdote recorded of him by his friend
and cotemporary, Vasari, which though it may not be
wholly true, has probably some foundation. This characteristic
anecdote is to the effect, that having received a payment
of sixty crowns in copper, he carried it home on foot in sultry
weather, and the over-fatigue brought on a fever, of which he
died. It is not, as Gibbon has shrewdly remarked, of much
importance whether an anecdote of a person is actually
true or false; for it almost equally displays the character
of the person of whom it is recorded. A tale of liberality
is not told of a known miser; nor an instance of penuriousness
of a liberal man. An anecdote, to be received, must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>at least be probable and have an air of verisimilitude.
Neither, considering the character of Correggio, is there
any such inconsistency in the story as to render it incredible.
The objection that sixty crowns in copper
would weigh two hundred pounds, and therefore be an
impossible weight for a man to carry, is a mere quibble.
It only proves that the quantity is exaggerated, and not
that the main story is false.</p>

<p class='c007'>The character of <span class='sc'>Vespasian</span> has been painted in the
brightest colours. Avarice alone sullied his virtues.
This must have been no slight or temporary blot, or his
eulogist and client, Tacitus, would not have recorded it.
It was too palpable and notorious to be concealed, and the
historian found himself, however reluctantly, compelled to
confess it.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>

<p>VESPASIAN.<br /><br />(<em>From a coin in the Museum of Florence.</em>)<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c012'><sup>[42]</sup></a></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It is not improbable, that he inherited this vice; for his
father, having saved money in the business of a collector
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>of the revenue and retired from the office, was unable to
resist the love of gain, and subsequently acquired a considerable
fortune by lending money at usurious interest.
The prudence and sagacity with which the young
Vespasian regulated his conduct during the dangerous
reigns of the brutal Caligula and Nero, indicates his
penetration and sagacity. It must have been by no
trifling tact and ingenuity that he escaped death for the
heinous offence of appearing inattentive while the Emperor
Nero was singing. The same shrewdness and insight
into character enabled him while in a private station to
redeem his ruined fortune by horse-dealing; a science
always notorious for its unscrupulous scheming and dishonest
sharp practice; and in which the hawk-nosed
Syrian Arabs have ever excelled all other nations.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Titus</span>, the successor and son of Vespasian, inherited
his father’s profile, and it is a marked corroboration of
our theory that avarice is the only vice attributed to that
otherwise virtuous prince.</p>

<p class='c007'>It must, however, be observed, that the Noses, both of
Vespasian and his son, were not purely Jewish, but
<em>Judæo-Roman</em> <span class='fraction'><span class='under'>IV</span><br />I</span>; a formation which corresponds accurately
with other peculiarities in the character of those
great generals, too well known to need further elucidation.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VII.<br /> <span class='large'>OF THE SNUB NOSE AND THE CELESTIAL NOSE.</span></h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Classes</span> V and VI.—The <span class='sc'>Snub Nose</span> and the <span class='sc'>Turn-Up</span> (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">poeticè</span></i> <span class='sc'>Celestial</span>) <span class='sc'>Nose</span>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The form of the former is sufficiently indicated by its name. The
latter is distinguished by its presenting a continuous concavity from
the eyes to the tip. It is converse in shape to the Jewish Nose.
N.B. It must not be confounded with a Nose which, belonging to
one of the other Classes in the upper part, terminates in a slight
distention of the tip; for this, so far from prejudicing the character,
rather adds to it warmth and activity.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>We associate the Snub and the Celestial in nearly the same category,
as they both indicate natural weakness; mean, disagreeable
disposition; with petty insolence, and divers other characteristics
of conscious weakness, which strongly assimilate them (indeed, a
true Celestial Nose is only a Snub turned up); while their general
poverty of distinctive character makes it almost impossible to distinguish
their psychology. Nevertheless, there is a difference
between their indications; arising, however, rather from degree
than character. The Celestial is, by virtue of its greater length,
decidedly preferable to the Snub, as it has all the above unfortunate
propensities in a much less degree, and is not without some share
of small shrewdness and fox-like common sense; on which, however,
it is apt to presume, and is, therefore, a more impudent Nose
than the Snub.</p>
<p class='c006'>It is with considerable distaste and reluctance that we
approach the latter divisions of our Classification. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pœnitet
me hujus Nasi.</span></i> We wish we had never undertaken to
write of these Noses. Having done so, however, we must
fulfil our engagement. But the mind shrinks from the
thought, that after contemplating the powerful Roman-nosed
movers of the world’s destinies, or the refined and
elegant Greek-nosed arbiters of art, or the deep and
serious-minded thinkers with Cogitative Noses, it must
descend to the horrid bathos, the imbecile inanity of the
Snub.</p>

<p class='c007'>Perhaps the reader expects that we are going to be
very funny on the subject of these Noses. But we are
not;—far from it. A Snub Nose is to us a subject of
most melancholy contemplation. We behold in it a proof
of the degeneracy of the human race. We feel that such
was not the shape of Adam’s Nose; that the original
type has been departed from; that the depravity of man’s
heart has extended itself to its features, and that, to parody
Cowper’s line, purloined, by the bye, from Cowley:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“God made the <em>Roman</em>, and man made the <em>Snub</em>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>Fortunately for our hypothesis, and for our feelings, we
cannot find a single instance of the existence of either the
Celestial or the Snub among celebrated persons, except
in those who are illustrious by courtesy rather than by
their actions, and whom station, not worth, has made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>conspicuous. The following are the only instances of the
Celestial Nose which our pictorial sources furnish:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>James I.</div>
      <div class='line'>Richard Cromwell.</div>
      <div class='line'>Mary, wife of William III.</div>
      <div class='line'>George I.</div>
      <div class='line'>Kosciusko.</div>
      <div class='line'>Boswell.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The “British Solomon” was unquestionably a witty
man, without being a wise one. In a subsequent chapter,
we take occasion to observe, that the exhibitions of character
in women are, from different causes, diverse from
those in men; and that as to the Celestial Nose, a woman
so endowed appears more witty than a similarly nosed
man, because she can dare to say what his fear of corporeal
chastisement would restrain. But kings, by their
position, are placed above such fear, and assume by their
rank what is granted to a woman for her sex. Hence the
impudence of the Celestial may develop itself in a king;
and James I was enabled to utter witticisms which he
would have prudently kept within his breast had he
occupied an inferior station.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are few individuals of whom more smart things
are recorded than of James I; but they are nearly all of
a character which none but a chartered libertine—a king,
a fool, or a woman—dare utter.</p>

<p class='c007'>Peculiar circumstances won <span class='sc'>Kosciusko</span> somewhat of a
name, for it was rather from sympathy with his cause
than from admiration of his abilities, that it was ever
bruited in men’s mouths, or is yet remembered. Had he
been gifted with a Roman Nose, that is, had his soul been
Roman, energetic, dignified and self-reliant, Poland might
have risen again into the rank of nations. But he submitted
to crouch beneath the rod of Napoleon, temporizing
and treating for benefits for which it was his duty to have
fought; and the nation, which looked to him for assistance,
was compelled to share his degraded fate, and become the
despised tool of an all-grasping despot. He had, however,
a share of the Cogitative with the Celestial; and thus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>affords an instance of an union so rare, that it is only
to be regarded as an exception to the rule laid down, that
Class III is never associated with V and VI.</p>

<div class='ic004'>
<p>KOSCIUSKO.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Boswell</span>, who has attained that sort of eminence which
a monkey might secure by mounting itself on the head of
an elephant, affords a striking corroboration of all the
characteristics attributed to the Snubbo-Celestial Nose.
What a contrast between his short, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">retroussé</span></i> nose and the
profoundly Cogitative and well-developed proboscis of the
literary giant on whose broad shoulders he elevated himself,
to display his mountebankism, and the self-degradation
of which his silly vanity made him unconscious. It was
the very excess of his self-esteem which made him unconscious
of the kicks and blows which his self-esteem was
continually doomed to receive at the hands of his “illustrious
friend.” His impudent vanity and blind obtuseness
rendered him insensible to the taunts and jeers, the ridicule
and contempt, which were lavished upon his imperturbable
imbecility. The great moralist tolerated his
presence for the sake of his flattery, and the utility of his
companionship when no one else would familiarize themselves
with the “literary bear.” Habit made his presence
essential; and Boswell—rather from natural weakness than
studied servility—was too useful a target for the arrows of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>the cross satirist, to be lightly laid aside by one to whom
disputation and contradiction were necessary stimulants.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every page in Boswell’s biography of Johnson demonstrates
the <em>meanness</em> of his disposition and the <em>weakness</em>
of his mind, redeemed only by a certain <em>small shrewdness</em>
and <em>fox-like common sense</em>, very useful to draw out the
aphorisms of his patron. His inherent <em>impudence</em> prompted
him to thrust himself into the society of the great literary
characters of the day, Johnson, Voltaire, Rousseau, &amp;c.,
where his vanity and self-esteem, coupled with his obtuseness
of intellect, sustained him, by rendering him as
impervious to their sarcasms and rebuffs, as the hide of
the rhinoceros is to the darts which would speedily annihilate
a more highly organized and sensitive animal.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nevertheless, the world owes much to Boswell’s imbecility.
His mind was a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">tabula rasa</span></i>, on which were
written down for our edification the sayings of a great
sage, pure and unalloyed, but which, if transmitted through
a mind of greater capacity, would have lost much of their
truthfulness and fidelity.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Murat</span> presents an instance of an illustrious Snub.
But it is notorious that Murat was never anything but a
tool in the hands of Napoleon. He was quite incompetent
to stand alone. He was a peacock’s feather in the hands
of a juggler—veering with the directive motion and breath
of the skilful balancer. Where he was laid, there he lay;
where he was set up, there he stood. Such men were
very needful to Napoleon. They were his best puppet-kings,
by which he hoped to govern Europe. Sometimes
he made a mistake, as in Bernadotte and his brother
Louis; but Murat and Joseph were most skilfully selected
to obey his ambitious impulses. Perhaps—as he is said to
have chosen able men for their long noses—he selected
these for their Snubs. Murat especially rejoiced in a most
egregious Snub, and certainly exhibited no mental qualifications
to belie the inference to be drawn from that form of
Nose.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is an important and very obvious corroboration of the
truth of Nasology, that the noses of children are generally
Snub or Celestial. This arises from their minds being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>unformed, and their characters undeveloped. As they
grow up, their minds gradually expand, their characters
assume individuality; and, coincident therewith, their
Noses acquire the formation expressive of their mental
tendencies.</p>

<p class='c007'>In little children, Snub or Celestial Noses are beautiful,
because they are congruous with our ideas of the ductility
and gentleness of childhood. A child with a great Roman
nose projecting from its rounded cheeks and innocent eyes,
would be an ugly child, though every feature were individually
perfect, because its nose would bespeak a force
and independence of mind which are revolting in a little
child.</p>

<p class='c007'>As we should recoil from a child which endeavoured to
entertain us with discourse suitable to a man of mature
years, instead of with innocent prattle, so we instinctively
dislike in a child the features belonging to manhood. The
beautiful harmony which reigns throughout all the works
of Nature, is in nothing more manifest than in the congruity
between the mind and the features, especially in
characterizing infantile and undeveloped minds by infantile
and undeveloped features.</p>

<p class='c007'>For the same reasons that the Snub prevails among
children, the same form prevails among savage nations and
the uneducated classes of civilized states. The Noses of
nations very low in the scale of civilization are for the
most part of a very flat and mean formation, of which
several instances will be adduced in a subsequent chapter;
and the Noses of the uneducated classes in every country
exhibit for the most part a greater proportion of Snubs
and Celestials than the Noses of the more highly educated
portions of the community: and this is more marked
when the want of education has subsisted for several successive
generations.</p>

<p class='c007'>From fictitious works, which have raised to celebrity
imaginary characters of every mental calibre, innumerable
examples might be adduced; for all accurate observers,
whether ancient or modern, have—without being professed
Nasologists—unconsciously verified our hypothesis,
and associated the Nose with character.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>The inimitable Dickens, and his equally clever illustrator
Cruikshank, both of whom owe their power to their
correct observation and delineation of character, afford
many well-known examples. Had the hypothesis been
founded on Oliver Twist and its illustrations, it could not
have been more strikingly substantiated by them, than it
is—thus proving that if we err, we err in company with
observers of more than common accuracy, and whose
observations have been verified by the applauses of all.
In that work we have the shrewd penetrative Jew with
his Hawk-nose; the mild, but high-minded Oliver Twist,
with his fine Greek Nose; the Artful Dodger and his
brother-pals with their characteristic Snubs and Celestials.
A reference to the plates, and the author’s pen-and-ink
portraits, in this and other works, will confirm our right
to claim these artists in pen and pencil as Nasologists.</p>

<p class='c007'>The same remarks would be equally applicable to
Hogarth’s illustrations of life in every grade. Observe the
important use he makes of the Nose to elevate or degrade
his characters. Compare for this purpose the Romano-Greek
Nose of the Industrious Apprentice with the
Snubbo-Celestial Nose of the Idle Apprentice. Nor does
Hogarth fall into the vulgar error of ridiculing rank and
station by features; with him features indicate mind only.
He used them to exhibit intellect and honesty, or imbecility,
vice, and vulgarity, in whatever station. The
Distressed Poet in his garret has a more intellectual nose
and countenance than the vicious and noble in Marriage
à-la mode, or the imbecile fop in the Rake’s Progress.</p>

<p class='c007'>Raffaelle likewise avails himself of the Nose to give
intellectual power and dignity to the Apostles, Peter and
John, in contrast with the uneducated beggar whose lameness
they miraculously cured at the beautiful gate of the
Temple.</p>

<p class='c007'>Even the distinctive characters of the two Apostles are
developed in their Noses; the loving, confiding, gentle
John by a Greek Nose, the energetic and fiery Peter by a
Roman Nose.</p>

<p class='c007'>But why multiply instances when every accurate pourtrayer
of character furnishes abundant examples?</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>The only authority which we have consulted on the
subject of Noses, is one from whose works we have already
quoted. It never can be forgotten that the inimitable
Tristram Shandy has slightly touched upon the subject
when describing the unhappy catastrophe which, even in
his very earliest years, demolished his Nose.</p>

<p class='c007'>It appears that Mr. Shandy, senior, was a sagacious, an
observant, and a learned man. We need not add, therefore,
that he was deeply impressed with the importance of
his son having a good Nose; and most pathetic was his
sorrow when the bridge of it was broken. His own
family had suffered through several generations from a
defect in the length of an ancestor’s Nose. His great-grandfather,
when tendering his hand and heart to the
lady who afterwards consented to make him “the happiest
of men,” was forced to capitulate to her terms, owing to
the brevity of his Nose.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is most unconscionable, Madam,” said he, “that
you, who have only two thousand pounds to your fortune,
should demand from me an allowance of three hundred
pounds a year.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Because you have no Nose, Sir.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“’Sdeath! Madam, ’tis a very good Nose.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“’Tis for all the world like an ace-of-clubs.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My great-grandfather was silenced:” and for many
years after the Shandy family was burdened with the
payment of this large annuity out of a small estate,
because his great-grandfather had a Snub Nose. Well
might Mr. Shandy (the father of Tristram) say, “that no
family, however high, could stand against a succession
of short Noses!”</p>

<p class='c007'>In lack of other instances, we have introduced those
of fictitious writers; for they corroborate our views, and
serve to thicken other proofs which in this Class do
demonstrate thinly. And this necessarily so. For we
have determined to refrain from giving examples from
our personal acquaintance, and the Snubs have never any
of them won such eminence, as to have their names handed
down by fame, or their portraits limned for the benefit
of posterity. The evidence in these two last Classes is
necessarily negative.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>Their best proof lies in their want of proofs. They
will, however, receive some general illustration when we
come to speak of national Noses.</p>

<p class='c006'>It now only remains to treat of some obstinate Noses
which will not come within our classification.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of these is that curious formation, a compound of
Roman, Greek, Cogitative, and Celestial, with the addition
of a button at the end, prefixed to the front of my Lord
Brougham. We are bound from its situation to admit
that it is a Nose, and we must, therefore, treat of it; but
it’s a queer one. “Sure such a Nose was never seen.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It is a most eccentric Nose; it comes within no possible
category; it is like no other man’s; it has good points,
and bad points, and no point at all. When you think it
is going right on for a Roman, it suddenly becomes a
Greek; when you have written it down Cogitative, it
becomes as sharp as a knife. At first view it seems a
Celestial; but Celestial it is not; its Celestiality is not
heavenward, but right out into illimitable space, pointing—we
know not where. It is a regular Proteus; when
you have caught it in one shape, it instantly becomes
another. Turn it, and twist it, and view it how, when,
or where you will, it is never to be seen twice in the same
shape, and all you can say of it is, that it’s a queer one.
And such exactly is my Lord Brougham—verily my Lord
Brougham, and my Lord Brougham’s Nose have not their
likeness in heaven or earth—and the button at the end is
the cause of it all.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus, though Lord Brougham’s Nose is an exception
to our classification, it is not, as has been asserted, an
exception to our system. On the contrary, it is manifestly
a strong corroboration of it. The only exceptions
are those where the <em>character does not correspond with the
Nose</em>, and of those we have yet to hear.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is another Nose which is not included in the
classification, but which, though not peculiar to <em>one</em> individual,
is nevertheless not sufficiently frequent to demand
placing there. This we call the Parabolic Nose. It would
have been a good Nose if it had gone on as it began; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>having from some cause taken an inward curve too soon,
its good qualities become nearly nullified. It presents a
continued Parabolic curve, where it ought to extend into
an angular tip. This sudden abbreviation of course
weakens the character, but, as it leaves the good qualities
of the upper part still inherent, the character retains good
points; but being disabled from reasoning justly on its
good intentions, it acquires the character of obstinacy,
and of acting from pig-headedness, instead of from rational
forethought.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>George III.</span> presents the best-known example of this
Nose.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another striking example occurs in <span class='sc'>Blanco White</span>.
There were considerable points of identity between their
characters.</p>

<p class='c007'>They were both honest, conscientious men, anxious to
find out and pursue the right course, but both were too
hasty in jumping to conclusions to form accurate judgments.
Blanco White, anxious to embrace truth, led a
regular harlequin dance after her all his life, and died in
motley. One leg red and the other blue, with a jacket
of various colours, and a coxcomb of brilliant self-conceit.
His last verdict, after rambling through divers forms of
religion and no religion, was, “I am neither Trinitarian,
nor Unitarian, nor yet Arian.” First Roman Catholic,
then Atheist, then Church of England, then Unitarian,
then Arian, then Omniarian, his ardent, hasty mind settled
like a butterfly on the first bright flower which fluttered
in the breeze, for a time imbibed and luxuriated on its
honey, and then flew off to suck the sweets of some other
plant. Thus he fluttered on, a varied, anxious, unsettled
existence, gathering honey, but making none; and when
the colds and storms of winter came, he sank before them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The instances of the Parabolic Nose are, however, too few
among celebrated persons to enable us to supply illustrations
probative of the accuracy of our notions of its indications.
It is, however, by no means an uncommon Nose,
and from personal observation among our cotemporaries,
we should say that it is not a very desirable form, as we
incline to think that it indicates obstinacy without any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>great elevation of mind, or deep capacity of reasoning.
But it would perhaps, at present, be most prudent not to
express decidedly what are its indications, &amp;c. Should
we be able to do so at any future time, it will be entitled
to stand as Class VII.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VIII.<br /> <span class='large'>OF FEMININE NOSES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The subject of Nasology would not be complete without
some observations on the Feminine Nose, because sex
modifies the indications, some of which, though disagreeable
and repulsive in a man, are rather pleasing, fascinating,
and bewitching in a woman, and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versâ</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is the fashion for women to aspire to equality with
the other sex, and as long as they will be content with an
equality, in a different orbit, they are undoubtedly entitled
to it. It should, however, be the equality of planets—each
perfect and beautiful, each useful and beneficial in its
sphere; but pregnant with disorder and confusion when
Venus would invade the orbit of Jupiter, or intrude within
the circuit of Mars.</p>

<p class='c007'>No intelligent man denies to woman such an equality;
but as certainly as a good housewife would pin a dish-cloth
to the coat-tail of a husband prying into the mysteries of
the kitchen and claiming equality with his wife in the
household sphere, so surely will men cry out against and
turn with disgust from women who invade their province
of warriors, statesmen, merchants, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nevertheless, let us not be misunderstood, or be accused
of including in a sweeping clause those cases which are, of
right, exceptions. A woman may be placed in such a position
that active life is her legitimate sphere, and that if
she neglects or devolves its cares upon others she is culpable.
We all feel an enthusiastic respect for the noble
Boadicea, arousing her pusillanimous countrymen against
the cruel ravages of the Romans, and dwell with admiration
on Elizabeth haranguing her army at Tilbury and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>personally engaging in affairs of State, because they were
occupied in duties which became a monarch; yet if a
woman, who has no call to any higher duties than those of
domestic life, were to leave them to engage in the contests
of warriors or the turmoil of politics, we should regard her
as an unfeminine virago. Notwithstanding, though the
woman may in some cases be needfully sunk in the station,
those duties which become the former will still engage more
of our love and regard than those which belong to the latter;
and our own graceful Queen has secured, by her happy
union of the duties of both, more of the love and respect of
her people than any of her predecessors on the throne of
these realms.</p>

<p class='c007'>The energies and tastes of women are generally less intense
than those of men; hence their characters appear
less developed and exhibit greater uniformity. That their
passions are stronger is undeniable, but these do not constitute
character, nor are exhibited in the Nose. Their
indexes are the eyes and mouth, and therefore their consideration
forms no part of the present subject. This
uniformity of character is noticed by Pope in a line which
at first sight reads libellous, either because it appears to
refer to moral conduct—which it does not—or because it
is too sweeping and exaggerated. He asserts roundly,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Most women have no characters at all.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>No characters at all, is obviously false; but, as compared
to men, as near the truth as most general epigrammatic
rules are. It is in the latter sense that Pope used it to
illustrate the difficulty of discussing “The characteristics
of Women” after a dissertation on those of men. The line,
however, was truer in his time than it is now, when more
general and more liberal education has tended very much
to break up the uniformity of character which existed
among the inane ladies of Pope’s era.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nevertheless, whether repressed by Art or curtailed by
Nature, women’s characters certainly <em>appear</em> less developed
than those of men. If by Nature, it is a blessed provision—as
all nature’s providings are. It is the woman’s place
to be in rational subjection to the man; and though the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>sweet saints would sooner tear out the eyes of St. Paul<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c012'><sup>[43]</sup></a>
(we wonder he is such a favourite with them) than confess
his precepts in terms, yet they do not fear to acknowledge
that they have no respect for the man who succumbs to his
wife, or admiration for the woman who aspires to denude
her husband of his appropriate symbols of masterdom.</p>

<p class='c007'>If this happy inferiority—an inferiority which places
them far above men in practical wisdom, inasmuch as it
consists in shrewd, practical common sense, against a man’s
intellectual blundering—if this happy inferiority is the
result of Art, they exhibit in its adoption much sound wisdom.
Man is an insolent, domineering, self-sufficient
animal—let him <em>say</em> what he will about the elevation of
the female mind, we believe no man ever fell in love with
the woman whom he felt to be wiser than himself. He
could not endure for a partner for life, such a perpetual
looking-glass and reminder of his own infirmities; he could
not bear the constant attestation of his own weakness. He
could regard patiently the vaunted accomplishments of
another man, but he could not submit that his wife should
be his acknowledged superior, and to be her foil—perhaps
fool.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hence it is that wise men, so frequently that it is become
proverbial, marry silly women. However much a learned
man may admire female accomplishments, he detests a
woman who strives to rival him in his own sphere, who is
talking philosophy when he would be whispering “soft
nothings,” and who freezes his ardent admiration with a
dissertation on mathematics, or a moral discourse on self-control.
He can bend, like any other man, with intense
joy, over the blushing girl who tremblingly believes that
her eyes are brighter and more lovely than the stars over
her head; but would fling from him with disgust the
woman who would repress his harmless and true—because
soul-felt—flattery, with a philosophical disquisition on the
nature, distances, and offices of the aforesaid stars. And
it is because learned women too often strive by this injudicious
ill-timed wisdom, to catch learned men for husbands,
(and there are no more determined husband-hunters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>than blue-stocking women, because they are always within
a year or two of being shelved), that the latter are necessarily
flung into the arms of women who they know <em>can’t</em>
bore them with an eternal round of sense, from which every
one is glad occasionally to escape, and never more so than
when he is in love.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hence it is that blue-stocking women are proverbially
avoided by men; not because men despise or dislike their
learning, but because they make such ill-timed use of it.
They may be admired, but they are never loved; they may
talk as learnedly as is in their power, but learning never
won a lover, much less a husband. <em>Ver. sap.</em> my dear lady
reader, and if you don’t understand the abbreviate, ask—ask—anybody,
but your husband.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Yes, Love, indeed, is light from heaven,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A spark of that immortal fire,</div>
      <div class='line'>By angels shared, to mortals given,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To lift from earth our low desire.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>And shall heaven-born love bow to mortal wisdom? Shall
the God whom Jove himself obeys, become the slave of
Minerva? No! let Love wear the cap and bells of Folly,
but shroud him not in the cold cerements of the Goddess of
Wisdom! Be assured, the doves of Venus will never nestle
under the dusky wings of the sage owl of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">innupta</span></i> Minerva,
who, herself, could never win a husband, or a lover, from
the whole host of Olympus.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whatever the cause, it is almost indisputable that
women’s characters are generally less developed than those
of men; and this fact accurately accords with the usual
development of their Noses. But for a small <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">hiatus</span></i> in the
prosody, Pope’s line would read equally well thus:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Most women have no Noses at all.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Not, of course, that the nasal appendage is wanting, any
more than Pope intended by the original line that women’s
characteristics were wholly negative; but that, like their
characters, their Noses are, for the most part, cast in a
smaller and less developed mould than the Nose masculine.</p>

<p class='c007'>In judging of the Nose feminine, therefore, comparison
must not be made with the masculine, but with other feminine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>Noses. All the rules and classifications apply to the
one as well as the other, but allowance is to be made for
<em>sex</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Roman Nose largely developed in a woman mars
beauty, and imparts a hardness and masculine energy to
the face which is unpleasing, because opposed to our ideas
of woman’s softness and gentle temperament. In a man
we admire stern energy and bold independence, and can
even forgive, for their sakes, somewhat of coarseness; but
in a woman the former are, at the least, unprepossessing
and unfeminine, and the latter is utterly intolerable.
Woman’s best sustainer is a pure mind; man’s a bold
heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>Moreover, the exhibition of character in women should
be different from that in men. From the masculine Roman
Nose we may justly look for energy in the active departments
of life, but in a woman its indications are appropriately
exhibited in firmness and regularity in those duties
which legitimately fall to her lot. We do not desire to
see a woman so endowed, launch out, uncalled for, into the
bustle and turmoil of the world, or endeavour to take the
reins of government from her husband, though she may
be equally well fitted for the task: but we are content to
see her govern her household with energy, and train up
her children in a systematic and uniform manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>She will form her plans of household management with
promptitude, and carry them out with undeviating firmness
and decision; and her husband will act wisely, for
his own sake, not to interfere with her, so long as her
energy does not carry her into his department.</p>

<p class='c007'>But if woman’s circumstances place her in a more extended
sphere, her career will afford an example to illustrate
our hypothesis as well as that of a man. Of this we
have an example in the illustrious Roman Lady, <span class='sc'>Livia</span>, the
wife of Augustus.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her Nose presents a combination of the Roman and the
Greek, and contains as much of the former class as is compatible
with female beauty. The accounts which are
handed down concerning her are very contradictory:
some describe her as chaste as the icicle that hangs on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>Dian’s temple, and qualified to lead a chorus of vestals,
while others accuse her of licentiousness and criminal
amours. It is, however, undeniable that she was a woman
of considerable power of mind, which she exercised energetically
and shrewdly in procuring the aggrandizement
of her son Tiberius, on whose head she finally succeeded
in placing the imperial tiara. Her Roman energy was
nevertheless refined by an infusion of Greek elegance, and
she was a liberal patroness of arts and literature. Her
career likewise illustrates another maxim; that what
woman’s character wants in development, is often compensated
by superior passion. Livia was sustained more
by the strength of her affections than by personal ambition.
It was her son’s and not her own aggrandizement that she
sedulously pursued; and if the lives of the majority of
ambitious women were examined, it would be found that
they more frequently sought to exalt some object of their
affections—a husband or a child—than themselves.</p>

<div class='ic004'>
<p>LIVIA.<br /><br />(<em>From a coin in the Museum of Florence.</em>)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>This, however, was not the case with the purely Roman-Nosed
<span class='sc'>Elizabeth</span>. She had no affection for any one but
herself; and the energy and determination, combined with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>the coarseness of her character, correspond accurately with
the indications of her Nose.</p>

<p class='c007'>The most beautiful form of Nose in woman is the Greek.
It is essentially a feminine Nose, and it is in its higher
indications that women generally excel.</p>

<p class='c007'>This Nose will not carry them out of their natural
sphere, and it is for this reason that it is so beautiful.
Congruity is harmony; and harmony is essential to the
beautiful. A woman gifted with the feelings of a poet,
need not fear to give them full sway. In some of the
most beautiful and touching departments of poetic talent
women equal—perhaps excel—men. Scarcely half a
century has elapsed since women were permitted to cultivate
unreservedly the fields of literature, but that brief
period has incontrovertibly proved the ability of women
to pourtray with superior truth and pathos all that relates
to the affections, the sentiments, and the moral and religious
duties of mankind.</p>

<p class='c007'>The names of Hannah More, Barbauld, Edgeworth,
Tighe, Hemans, De Staël, and other lamented writers,
together with those of several who still survive, place this
assertion beyond the pale of controversy. The Noses of
the above-named gifted women were Greco-Cogitative.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_p113.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic004'>
<p>MRS. HEMANS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>But the power of expression, though essential to a
poet, is not necessary to a poetic mind. It may exist as
strongly in one who has no words of fire to give its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>creations utterance as in one who pours forth in lavish
self-abandonment the riches of his soul.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Oh many are the Poets that are sown</div>
      <div class='line'>By Nature; men endowed with highest gifts,</div>

      <div class='line in36'><span class='sc'>Wordsworth.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>Neither is the Greek Nose a necessary index of a poetic
faculty. That form may adorn the face, but no rapturous
fervour exalt the mind; although it will frequently
accompany a poetic temperament, because it indicates
refinement and purity of taste. These are its invariable
indications, and in these every woman so gifted will
excel; for to excel in these is almost her peculiar province.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the minor and domestic departments of life, where
woman’s influence is so peculiarly blessed, the refinement
of the Greek Nose will appear in those household
arrangements which make home the happiest and most
beloved spot on earth. It will exhibit itself in her
needlework by an artistic arrangement of colours and a
poetic choice of subjects; in a neat and elegant attire,
in the decoration of her drawing-room, or in the paraphernalia
of her boudoir. Nor need it be confined to
those elegancies which seem to belong exclusively to the
higher classes—a cup of flowers in a cottage window, the
well-selected trimmings of a Sunday cap, or a pretty ornament
on the mantel-shelf will equally be an evidence of a
refined taste, and found to accompany the Greek Nose.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Cogitative Nose does not so frequently appear among
women as among men. Women rather <em>feel</em> than think.
Their perceptions are instinctive, intuitive; men’s cogitative.
They are shrewder and more instantaneous in estimating
character, or in deciding an action, than men. Men must
think, and fume, and fret, before they can decide; must,
in common parlance, set the head (reason) against the
heart (instinct); while women rely more on the latter, and
are consequently, in judging of character, or in deciding
on a course of moral conduct, more frequently right than men.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>Our advice to a man would be this: if you are at a loss,
after long cogitation—as ten to one you will be—to know
whether an intended act is morally right, ask a sensible
woman, and she will guide you with perfect wisdom in a
minute. So, again, if you would know any one’s moral
character, let a sensible woman converse with him for five
minutes, and she will tell you without fail whether he may
be trusted. Only be careful to accept her first dictum;
don’t argue the point with her, nor give her time to <em>think</em>;
have her instinctive decision. If she thinks, she will be
ten times more at fault than a man; and, if you argue the
matter with her, she will lead you a dance through as fine
a quagmire of absurdities as can be conceived, and there
leave you, up to your neck in the slough, without the
power—if not without the will—to help you out. And
this needfully so. Instinct must ever be a better guide
than Reason; for</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“In this (Instinct) ’tis <span class='sc'>God</span> that acts, in that (Reason) ’tis man.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“The perception of a woman,” says Sherlock, “is as
quick as lightning. Her penetration is intuition, almost
instinct. By a glance she will draw a quick and just conclusion.
Ask her how she formed it, and she cannot
answer the question. While she trusts her instinct she is
scarcely ever deceived, but she is generally lost when she
begins to reason.” A more accurate picture of the female
mind was never drawn; yet some modern writers have
fiercely controverted it. Under a mistaken notion of
equalizing women with men, they seek to destroy the individualism
of their character. One witty popular writer has
even ventured to assert, that if half-a-dozen boys were
brought up as girls, and half-a-dozen girls as boys, the
latter would be to all intents psychologically men, and the
former psychologically women. Surely a more preposterous
absurdity never won the assent of the unthinking
part of the community; nevertheless, it has been warmly
applauded and often repeated, as if it were an ascertained
fact instead of a ridiculous fancy.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Jewish Nose is not very frequent among women.
Neither are its indications material to the perfection of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>the female character. It is the duty of men to relieve
women from the cares of commercial life, and to stand
between them and those who would impose upon their
credulity. Moreover, woman’s natural penetration supplies
the want of the thoughtful sagacity which protects men in
inter-commercial relations.</p>

<p class='c007'>The remarks which we made on the Snub Nose and the
Celestial Nose in men, require to be considerably modified
when we treat of those classes in women.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Celestial Nose feminine is that which has won so
much admiration and celebrity among French writers
under the designation of “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le nez retroussé</span></i>.” They almost
universally acknowledge its irresistible piquancy and animation.
According to Marmontel, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">un petit nez retroussé
renvers les lois d’un empire</span>;” a dictum which we are not
disposed to dispute.</p>

<p class='c007'>We confess a lurking <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">penchant</span></i>, a sort of sneaking affection
which we cannot resist, for the latter of these in a
woman. It does not command our admiration and respect
like the Greek, to which we could bow down as to a
goddess, but it makes sad work with our affections. The
former, too, is not so unbearable as in a man. It is a
great marrer of beauty, undoubtedly; but merely regarded
as an index of weakness, it claims our kindly consideration.
Weakness in a woman—which is gentleness, feminacy—is
excusable and rather loveable; while in a man it is
detestable. It is woman’s place to be supported, not
to support. Hence the classical emblem of the Vine
and the Elm is felt to be beautiful and true, because
it pourtrays accurately the natural mutual position of
husband and wife. A woman, moreover, has generally
tact sufficient to conceal (often to their entire annihilation)
those unprepossessing characteristics of the Snub and the
Celestial, which in a weak man become every day more and
more strongly marked. A woman’s weakness, too, is rather
flattering, as it attests our supremacy; a thing which we
like to be constantly reminded of, and of which we are
very jealous, as it stands on rather ticklish and much disputed
ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>The impudence, too, which is utterly unendurable in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>male Celestial, and which seems to court contact with the
toe of one’s boot, is in a woman rather piquant and interesting.
A Celestial Nose in a woman is frequently an
index of wit. Wit is a talent not emanating from wisdom;
quite the reverse. The wisest men are ofttimes the
slowest. Wisdom comes after thought, wit before it. A
Celestial-nosed woman is only more witty than a similarly
gifted man, because the impudence which it invariably indicates
is backed by woman’s ever-ready tact and quickness.</p>

<p class='c007'>The indications are not varied; but the exhibitions are.
Even if a man were gifted with the power of uttering
the severe witticisms and cutting repartees which are

he dare not; for he would be inevitably kicked down
stairs—if the fellow were worth the exertion.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a witty woman who can skirmish with unflinching
quickness and dexterity, we can even forgive a slight
moral delinquency. A little white-lie simpered out with
arch assurance by a pair of demure lips,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>

    <div class='group'>

</div>

<p class='c019'>by no means offends us as it would in a man; in whom
we should attribute it to low cunning or mean cowardice.
Indeed, the exquisite look of arch impudence with which
a delicately chiselled marble-ine Celestial tells you a most
palpable falsehood is maddening, perfectly beautiful,
almost sublime. The cool assurance and sharp raillery
with which she persists after detection! the assumption
of injured innocence! the impudent look of defiance! By
Jove! truly</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>And then when they are beaten from their last defence,
and can resist no longer, when they are compelled to
surrender and beg pardon, they do it as if <em>they</em> were forgiving
<em>you</em>; and make you feel almost as if you were
being forgiven, as if you, not she, had all the while been
erring: at all events you feel very like a fool, though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>very happy; and so a few tears, and a few (or not a <em>few</em>)
kisses set all to rights,</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ha, ha, ha!” roars Mr. A. flinging down the book—which
he has been reading aloud to his wife—in a paroxysm
of laughter.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s abominable!” exclaims Mrs. A., in high indignation,
“and I wonder, Mr. A. you ain’t ashamed to read it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. A. resumes the book, and his lady continues to
listen with great interest, though apparently wholly
absorbed by her crochet-work.</p>

<p class='c007'>All things considered therefore, and inasmuch as we
prefer the naturalness of a witty woman to the artificialness
of a learned woman, we confess to a liking for the
Celestial Nose feminine, while we abhor the masculine.
It is not, however, every female Celestial Nose that we
admire (Heaven, for our peace’s sake forbid—they are so
numerous). It must be of the purest and most delicate
chiselling; have no tendency to cogitativeness, lest it
should look as if its owner thought; and its hue must
be of the palest and most evanescent flesh-tint. These
are essential to indicate that delicacy of mind which alone
makes wit in a woman fascinating and which pardons
breaches of strict morality committed from the purest and
most benevolent intentions.</p>

<p class='c007'>This sounds rather paradoxical, but an old Jacobite
song will illustrate our meaning. The story goes that a
gudewife concealed a north country cousin, one of the
adherents of Charlie, in the house, unknown to the gudeman;
and her ingenuity is sorely puzzled to account for
certain suspicious phenomena which strike him on his
coming home:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Hame came our gudeman at e’en,</div>

      <div class='line in6'>‘Boots!’ quo’ she; (<em>with amazement</em>)</div>
      <div class='line in6'>‘Aye, boots!’ quo’ he.</div>

      <div class='line in4'>‘Water-stoups?’ quo’ he,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>‘Aye, water-stoups;’ quo’ she.” (<em>with impudent determination</em>).</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>And so in like manner she unblushingly persists, in
order to preserve her guest’s life, that a saddle-horse is a
milking cow, and a man’s coat a pair of blankets. Now
we are sure this dear woman had a Celestial Nose; nothing
else would have had the ready wit and impudent assurance
to attempt so to befool her gudeman, and to persist, with
the addition of no slight abuse of his dotard blindness,
in her palpable falsehoods; yet we defy any one not to
love the good woman, and excuse her breaches of morality
for the sake of her hospitable benevolence.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whenever two persons, the one having a large Nose
and the other a small one, come into collision, the latter
must inevitably yield, unless it is feminine, and takes a
Celestial turn. It may then conquer, not by its wisdom or
the force of argument, but by its persevering impudence,
and harassing petty skirmishing. A wise man may, for
the sake of peace and quiet, ostensibly yield to a noisy
woman; though there is no real conquest, for he remains
unconvinced.</p>

<p class='c007'>But a Snub-nosed man must succumb, body and soul, to a
Roman-nosed wife; she will assume the masterdom; she
will endue the breeches; he cannot help himself; under her
his nature is subdued, as Marc Antony’s was by Cæsar.</p>

<p class='c007'>Take warning, therefore, ye Snub Noses; and if ye
would be masters at home, marry your likes. Aspire not
to wed feminine beauty; it is not for such as you. Marry
Snubs; beget Snubs, till the race is extinct.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>We are conscious that in discussing female Noses, we
are treading on delicate ground. It is a difficult and
nervous subject. We have endeavoured, however, to say
nothing but what appeared to us to be plain truth. Nevertheless
we would apologize if we have given offence to
any one, were it not that we forcibly feel the truth of the
homely adage, “the least said the soonest mended,” and
therefore hasten to close a chapter which has given us
more trouble and anxiety than all the rest together.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IX.<br /> <span class='large'>OF NATIONAL NOSES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The reader will probably have been led from the
nomenclature to inquire whether the assertion that certain
forms of Nose are justly named after certain nations
might not be extended further? and whether every nation
has not a characteristic Nose?</p>

<p class='c007'>The reply to these questionings would be in the affirmative.
Every nation has a characteristic Nose; and the
less advanced the nation is in civilization, the more
general and perceptible is the characteristic form. While
nations are in their infancy, and the mass of the people
are uninformed, the features receiving no impressions
from within, take the form impressed from without, and
follow the national type. If one uniform state of things—of
government, climate, and habits—continue, without
education, generation may succeed generation, and the
original facial type of the race will remain. If, however,
the national circumstances alter (still without general
education) the national features follow the type impressed
by those circumstances. We have appealed to many
instances of these simultaneous national changes when
describing the different forms of Noses prevalent at different
periods of English history.</p>

<p class='c007'>The existence of such typical features has always been
recognized, and ethnologists have founded classifications
of the Human Race on their peculiarities.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>It is an additional general proof of the truth of Nasology,
that the most highly-organized and intellectual races possess
the highest forms of Noses, and those which are more
barbarous and uncivilized possess Noses proportionately
Snub and depressed, approaching the form of the snouts
of the lower animals, which seldom or ever project beyond
the jaws. Thus the Caucasian races, denominated by Dr.
Prichard Oval-headed, which comprise decidedly the most
perfect specimens of the human race, are characterized by
a Nose Roman or Greek; while the lower divisions, the
Mongolian or Pyramidal-headed, and the Negro or Prognathous
(protruding-jawed)—than among which no lower
and more debased specimens of humanity subsist—have
Noses Celestial or Snub, as in the Tartar and Chinese,
the Negro and Hottentot nations.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Caucasian, or Elliptical-headed, types of the
Human Race, the Nose averages one-third of the faces.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Mongolian, or Pyramidal-headed, the Nose averages
from one-fourth to one-fifth of the face.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Negro, or Prognathous-jawed, it is the same, and
the nostrils are conspicuous, as in brutes.</p>

<p class='c007'>When hypotheses thus assist and strengthen each
other, we gain an assurance of their truth and accuracy
which is wanting where they are seemingly contradictory,
and which would have been wanting to Nasology, had it
contradicted the observations of philosophers so careful
and able as Dr. Prichard and his fellow-labourers in the
field of ethnology. Happily this is not the case, and
Nasology may claim to stand as the handmaid of ethnologists
striving to discover the characteristics of nations.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the more highly-organized races more deviations
from the original typical patterns occur than among the
lower-organized—because the minds of civilized men are
more impressible than those of savages. Travellers have
always observed that nothing struck them more on
visiting a savage nation than the great uniformity of feature,
presenting so great a contrast to the diversities
among civilized nations; so that while a superficial observer
would suppose it to be impossible to characterize
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>the latter by any uniform description, he finds no difficulty
in expressing the characteristics of the former.</p>

<p class='c007'>Various degrees of culture and occupation produce the
greatest possible variations among the individuals of civilized
nations, while the uniform absence of education and
the uniformity of pursuits among savages perpetuate, and
perhaps confer, an uniform national physiognomy.</p>

<p class='c007'>When education becomes general, nations lose their
national typical features; for the physiognomy becomes
so variously impressed from within, according to the
different bias and affections of men’s minds, that it
ceases to receive those impressions from without, which
generate national types. At present, however, there is so
little generally diffused education that the typical features
of most nations may yet be defined.</p>

<p class='c007'>These are not always the original types of the race.
Numerous circumstances have among the more civilized
nations contributed to produce changes of greater or less
magnitude. The various Caucasian nations, for instance,
though all descended from one stock, have varied from
their original type in their divers migrations from the
plains of Asia, and received such typical form as varying
circumstances have since impressed. Hence the various
Caucasian nations of Europe and Western Asia differ
considerably from each other in mental and bodily organization.</p>

<p class='c007'>These variations from the original type took place,
however, at so early a period, even in the ante-historical
period, that historians are apt to regard them as original
and innate; and perhaps it is most convenient for <em>them</em>
to do so. But this is not sufficient for the inquirer into
the Races of Men. He goes back to ages far beyond the
historical, or even the mythic, period; and, finding these
nations are descended from one family, perceives that the
present variations must have taken place after the dispersion
of the family into distant localities under leaders
of very various temperament and views of social happiness.</p>

<p class='c007'>It would lead us too far to inquire whether the tendency
of Nature to break up certain types into varieties,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>and form new races—perhaps even new species and
genera—was not originally greater than it has been at
any period within the knowledge of man. We see no
changes take place now, such as long before even the
mythic period, produced from one stock the wild urus,
the domestic ox, and the hunched bull of India. Neither
do we see new races of men spring up; such as in the
very earliest times produced from one common ancestor
the various diverse races of men; white, black, yellow,
and red.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is a singular proof both of the tendency of the human
race to break into varieties at a very early period, and of
the permanency of those varieties in later ages—that the
four races into which Blumenbach and the best writers
have agreed to divide the races of the old world are distinctly
recorded and separated in like manner on some
of the most ancient monuments of Egypt. On the tomb
of Osirei, father of the Great Rameses, are represented the
“dwellers upon earth as well those of Egypt as those of
foreign countries.” Four figures are given in each group, and
are coloured to represent the Tawny, the Yellow, the Black,
and the White Races, respectively, with features corresponding
to those of the same races in the present day.
Such facts should teach us that the laws which regulate
the generation and production of species and races are
very different from those which regulate reproduction and
succession, and that while we endeavour to explain the
laws of origination by the laws of reproduction, we shall
never arrive at the true solution of the origination of types.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is no poetical fancy that Nature’s infancy was
more active than its later years; that “Nature wantoned
in her prime,” and produced more gigantic effects
than now. Not that the powers of nature are weakened:
but the purpose having been accomplished, its workings
are stayed by the fiat of the Almighty God, and are
employed in sustaining and reproducing, instead of generating
anew and creating. When those powers are
wanted again, they will spring into undecayed operation;
let a new continent rise from the deep and the new world
have to be people, and Nature will again resume the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>gigantic forces of its infancy, and become young to fill
with life and activity a young world.</p>

<p class='c007'>But at whatever period impressed, certain it is that
many nations have a typical form of Nose, together with
other peculiar distinctive features; and it concerns us now
rather to regard the fact as it exists than to inquire how it
happened.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Roman, the Greek, and the Syrian forms of Nose
have been already descanted upon, as forming three bases
of our nomenclature. The present European nations are
the Gothic, the Celtic, the Sclavonic, and the Finnish.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Gothic has been subjected to so many varying
circumstances that it is now perhaps impossible to assert,
with confidence, its original natural form. Where a uniform
dull system of despotism, political and religious, has for
centuries bound down these nations in abject servitude, the
Nose is sharp, devoid of Cogitativeness, and Romano-Greek
in profile.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is the case with the Spanish Goths and with those
of France and Italy. These nations were so long held in
mental thraldom that they ceased to cultivate cogitative
powers which it was dangerous to use. Where espionage
and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lettres de Cachet</span></i>, the Inquisition and Monachism dog
and punish men’s secret thoughts, and forbid the expression
of any sentiment breathing a spirit opposed to the powers
that be, or demonstrative of a disposition to inquire into
the why and wherefore of political and religious dogmas,
the mind, by an instinct of self-preservation, must cease to
think. Where to think is a death-warrant, where a look
of reflection or an aspect of discontent may be followed by
the axe of the executioner, or the more fearful incarceration
by the gaoler, the mind has no alternative but to forget
itself and live in bestial oblivion, to “sit down to eat and
drink and rise up to play.” With the cessation of the
Cogitative powers, the Cogitativeness of the features will
disappear, and the Nose will become defective in breadth,
thin and sharp. To this want of reflection succeeds, in
the naturally higher and more energetic nations, animal
passion; and if ever the pressure is removed from the
national mind and it obtain the upper hand of its keepers,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>fearful retribution and sanguinary revenge inevitably ensue.
They who lived the animal life of a caged wild beast in
apparent ease and quietude, well fed and perhaps, sensually,
better provided for than if left to their native freedom,
will, when let loose from confinement, fearfully
vindicate the natural law of liberty, and with an insane
instinct tear in pieces the keepers who have fed them for
their own purposes and nurtured them for their own
pleasure and profit, reckless of the natural social rights of
man.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is for this reason that the sharp, thin unthinking
Nose appears symbolical likewise of cruelty; not so much
because the natural disposition is cruel, as because the
mind, when unchained, acts from animal impulse and not
from sage reflection; and animal revenge is always wild
and cruel.</p>

<p class='c007'>We say this of nations which, like the Gothic and
other Caucasian races, were originally well organized and
endowed with higher capacities. This higher organization
exhibits itself—whatever the degrees of Cogitativeness
which incidental circumstances may have added, or
adeemed—in a profile, Roman, or Greek, or compounded
of both; and which may therefore be called nationally
Romano-Greek. The profile not being so subject to
variation from the pressure of external circumstances as
the breadth, remains still pretty uniformly the same in all
the Caucasian races in Europe, which might be written
<span class='fraction'>I<br /><span class='vincula'>II</span></span>. Other races there are which, either naturally of less
penetrable stuff, and a lower and more obtuse organization,
or longer ground down beneath a more crushing and
uniform despotism, remain contented slaves and willing
bondmen. This degradation, as we shall see when we
come to speak of the Asiatic nations, appears also in their
Noses.</p>

<p class='c007'>France, Spain, and Italy have been depressed, not only
beneath a political despotism till within a very recent
period, but under the still more soul-crushing despotism
of a gross superstition and corrupt religion—the latter
even more than the former has repressed Cogitativeness
in those nations. If there is one subject which more than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>another interests the human mind and occupies the
thoughts, it is its religion—its eternal prospects—for Man
is essentially a religious animal. Debarred from exercising
thought upon its most natural and interesting
topics—and all other subjects being dragged within the
jealous circle of a religious despotism—so stern a barrier
is opposed to thought that the mind rarely dare overleap
it. While a political despotism may be well pleased to
see its subjects occupied in scientific or metaphysical
researches, in order to wean them from too critical an
examination of itself, a religious despotism forbids any
such researches unless made within the small circle it has
prescribed. Death or imprisonment awaits a Galileo or a
Copernicus, as it would under a similar rule, even now,
await a Buckland or a Lyell.</p>

<p class='c007'>At present, we lament that we can see nothing in the
recent revolutionary movements in France and Italy, to
indicate the existence of those Cogitative powers, the
want of which has always hitherto checked their advancement
towards true liberty and self-government.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, as in 1793, there seems “equally a want of books
and men; without which, after a few years of bloodshed
and anarchy, those countries must again submit to a
despotic form of government. No country can be governed
without intellect; and if that is not to be found in
the many, the few who possess it must become the ruler.</p>

<p class='c007'>This country has never long needed such a despotism.
Germany, too, though hardly yet freed from a political
despotism, has through a large portion of its area long
thrown off the despotism of Rome, and embraced the
more elevating and life-giving doctrines of the Reformation.
In those provinces where this blessed change has
taken place, Germany is starting rapidly into that career of
intellectuality which England commenced three hundred
years ago. The Germans and the English are preeminently
deep-thinking nations; and in both of them is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>the Nose more decidedly and more generally of a Cogitative
form than in any other Gothic nations.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Cogitative may therefore, perhaps, be said to be
one of the characteristic forms of the Noses of those
Gothic branches, and might be expressed thus, (I + II)/III.
Nevertheless, various degrees of education and various
pursuits, with (in England) free institutions, have so diversified
their features that they exhibit a much less uniform
character than the features of most other nations.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Anglo-Americans afford a further corroborative
proof that the Cogitative Nose is dependent on the cultivation
of a Cogitative mind. They present a striking
contrast to their puritan forefathers,—men who abandoned
home, country and friends for the sake of religious and
political opinions; men to whom conscience was dearer
than life, and freedom more precious than worldly advantage;
men of the strictest integrity, the most
scrupulous honesty, and the sternest firmness, sullied only
by an excess of over-wrought feeling—fanaticism. All
these virtues, and this vice (itself a virtue gone mad) are
wanting to the American character. That there are happy
exceptions, it is true; but a nation which boasts <em>smartness</em>
as its most prominent virtue, must not complain if it is
accused of want of principle. The circumstances of
young America have contributed to render hers an unthinking
people. The wild life to which so large a portion
have been subjected, cut off from all neighbourhood,
debarred from communication with cultivated minds,
thrown entirely on the active business of the day for
mental food, they have necessarily degenerated from the
thinking men to whom they are indebted for their origin.</p>

<p class='c007'>So far from the American Nose inheriting the Cogitative
form of their ancestors’, it is thin and sharp; and, as a
national nose, the most unthinking of any of the Gothic
stock. America is, however, a fast-growing nation; it
has had no infancy, but started at once into life, a full-grown
youth. There is hope, therefore—of which already
some assurance has been given—that it will yet furnish
its quota of thinkers to the history of the human mind.</p>

<p class='c007'>Strange as the assertion may appear, it is susceptible of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>many proofs, that the now degraded and dwindled Celts
were originally the most powerful and widely dispersed
people of the earth, boasting simultaneously a geographical
extent and political importance, which have been achieved
only by successive generations of the Gothic branches of
the Indo-Germanic nations.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Aborigines, Autochthones, Gigantes, Titanides (all
which names signify earth-born), Atlantides, Cyclopeans,
Pelasgi, Umbri, Etrusci and Sikeli, the Iotuns in Scandinavia,
Pali in India, Kaous in Persia, Hycsos in Egypt,
may all equally, by plausible and unanswerable facts, be
surmised to have been Celts, with whom the immigrators
of other races waged continual wars for possession of the
earth. All the myths—so universal—of the wars of the
gods and the giants, relate to wars between the invading
conquerors and the primitive inhabitants, who are everywhere
to be traced by their gigantic works of unhewn stone,
cromlechs, stone circles, &amp;c., not referable to any historic
period, because the conquerors destroyed all records of
their architects, and then, in idiotic wonder at their vast
dimensions, referred them to gigantic first possessors of
the earth.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whether the original stature of the Celts was greater
than that of the Gothic nations, may be doubted; but it is
a curious fact that nearly all the modern European giants
have been Celts, and immense stature was a common property
of the wild Irish of former generations.</p>

<p class='c007'>The existing Celtic races call for more extended observation.
As an un-Gothicized nation, the Irish is the only
remnant of a people which probably was at one time thinly
spread over the whole of Europe. Nearly related to, if not
originally identical with, the Goths, yet naturally of a less
vigorous constitution and lower habit of mind, the Celts
rapidly gave way before, or irretrievably amalgamated themselves
with, their Pelasgian invaders in Greece and Italy,
and their Gothic invaders in Trans-Alpine Europe.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus, at one time losing themselves in the overwhelming
flood of their invaders, like the waters of a lake inundated
by the sea; at another, retreating westerly before the oncoming
torrent, the Celtic nations have gradually almost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>disappeared from continental Europe, and alone find a
miserable home and wretched abiding-place on the most
eastern shores of the Atlantic, and the most western
corners of the Old World.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the Atlantic could have afforded them a footing upon
its turbulent waters, they would long since have been
driven into it by their rapacious invaders. The complaint
of the unhappy Celts has, ever since they were hunted to
the extreme west of Europe, been the same, “Our
enemies drive us into the sea; and the sea drives us back
upon our enemies.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Saxon ingenuity has, however, at last endeavoured to
circumvent the sea. If it cannot receive <em>into</em> its bosom
the last wreck of the Celts, it can carry them <em>upon</em> it to
lands still further west, there to pine, and dwindle away
and die; out of sight, and therefore out of the mind, of
the haughty invader, who turns with well-feigned horror
and disgust from the ruin and degradation which he has
wrought.</p>

<p class='c007'>To make room for himself, he expatriates the ancient
owners of the soil, not only without remorse or compunction,
but with much self-laudation and pharisaical
pride that he has not extirpated them, and has not—only

<p class='c007'>It is no fiction that after British Christianity had been
driven by Saxon Paganism from Britain into Ireland, the
Irish Celts furnished the best schools for literature, and
the ablest scholars in Europe—and it is no fiction that
ever since the Saxon has set foot in Ireland it has continued
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>to droop and decay, until it is now a foul bog of
iniquity; a wretched irreclaimable sink of inhuman vice
and monstrous infamy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Its Cogitativeness has been repressed till it cannot reflect
nor appreciate any but physical modes of escape from
thraldom. This is but the caged wild beast gnawing at its
chain, and snapping at its keeper, whether his hand
approaches to feed or to beat it.</p>

<p class='c007'>It may be said, escape lies open to it in self-elevation,
in moral rectitude, and industrious exertion; but it is too
late for it to see and understand that. We might as well
say to the broken leg, walk now, you walked once; or to
the encaged madman, calm yourself and be free, you were
calm and free once.</p>

<p class='c007'>We need no better proof of the non-cogitativeness of
Ireland than the facile manner in which it throws itself
beneath the Juggernautic car of every demagogue, and
sacrifices itself to his avaricious cruelty. We need no
better proof of the truth of our theory, than that the Nose
of the same nation is deficient in Cogitativeness, and is for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>the most part thin and sharp. It has not, however, lost
the Romano-Greek profile, usual among the Caucasian
races.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is true in the main; but unhappily more recent
information compels us to modify it, and add another proof
of Nasology from degradation of physical structure simultaneously
with mental degradation. “There are certain
districts in Leitrim, Sligo, and Mayo” (as pointed out by
an intelligent writer in the Dublin University Magazine,
No. 48), chiefly inhabited by descendants of the native
Irish driven by the British from Armagh and the south of
Down, about two centuries ago. These people, whose
ancestors were well-grown, able-bodied, and comely, are
now reduced to an average stature of five feet two inches,
are pot-bellied, bow-legged, and abortively featured, and
are especially remarkable for “open projecting mouths,
with prominent teeth, and exposed gums, (<em>i. e.</em> prognathous-jawed—the
Negro type), their advancing cheekbones,
and <em>depressed noses</em>, bearing barbarism on their very
front.” In other words, within so short a period, they seem
to have acquired a prognathous type of skull, like the
savages of Australia, “thus giving such an example of
deterioration from known causes, as almost compensates by
its value to future ages, for the sufferings and debasement
which past generations have endured in perfecting its
appalling lesson.”<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c012'><sup>[46]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The study of the British Legislature should be “How to
get” Ireland a Cogitative Nose; not by any surgical
process, such as that of the</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>for phlebotomizing is the worst mode of legislation—but
by cultivating in her people a Cogitative mind; well
assured that whether or not the attempt succeed in developing
their probosces, it will be well repaid by other and
more important improvements in their condition. How
this is to be effected would afford matter for an interesting
essay; but it would be out of place here, though we have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>our nostrums on the subject like every other political
doctor, and cannot resist saying that it will never be done
by “Constitutional” Legislation, which is only fitted for
the Teutonic races. The Irish, like the cognate race, the
French, must be governed by an enlightened despotism;
they must be gently pushed on by their leaders to their
own good, while the Teutonic races may be safely left to
push on their leaders—treading, not always too gently, on
their heels, by way of hint to get on. It is a most fatal
error in legislation to disregard the psychonomic differences
in races, and under a philanthropic pretence of the
natural equality of man, to endeavour to govern all by the
same laws and institutions.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was the sad misfortune of Ireland to be conquered
after the downfall of the feudal system, and to be at once
inducted—with sanguinary and therefore ineffective restrictions
on their use—into free forms of government.
The feudal system, in its original integrity—without its
on-grafted abuses, as fines, heriots, &amp;c. &amp;c.—is almost the
only system on which a naturally high-class but barbarous
race can be held down, while they are being elevated in
the scale of humanity; and if for three or four generations
Ireland could be subjected to pure and beneficent feudality—whereby
every man would be linked to a superior, and
be compelled to exert himself to retain his feud—together
with the Alfredic tithing-man system—to prevent or detect
and punish crime—it might be gradually placed on such
an equality with England, as to enable it to be safely
governed on the same constitutional principles. Perhaps,
however, it is rather to be wished that this had been done
in past times, than to attempt it now: it might be dangerous
to the liberties of England to retrograde; for it must
be admitted that a return to feudality is retrogression, and
the state of external peace to which it would bring Ireland
might afford an argument to future English Legislatures,
to tie down the turbulent liberties of England with the
same bonds—which God forbid! better live in a storm
than rot in a calm.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is the unhappy fate of Ireland that its evils are past
remedy. Her woes are the executioners of God’s judgments
against England for the latter’s crimes towards her.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>Ireland suffers that she may be a sharp thorn in the side—perhaps
a dagger in the heart—of England. No nation
sins without retribution from the quarter against which the
crime has been committed, and much more evil must
England suffer from Ireland ere an equivalent punishment
has been inflicted. Nevertheless Ireland is not wretched
only because England must suffer; she is wretched for her
own crimes, and her wretchedness is over-ruled to be the
punishment of her oppressor likewise.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is by no means an isolated instance of the duality
of purposes in the Divine judgments. The crimes of a
nation have ofttimes been made the punishment of itself
and another; so likewise, among individuals, the visitation
of one man’s sins frequently extends to punish the faults, or
try the virtue, of his friends and relations.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ambitious pride of Babylon punished the idolatry
of the Israelites, but at the same time brought down ruin
on itself. The conquest of America punished the gross
vices and savage idolatries of the natives, and at the same
time retributed the cruelties and crimes of their punishers
by inundating Spain with the gold and silver which has
wrought her present degradation. May we not add that
England’s punishment of the revolutionary crimes of
France, is now retributing her own commercial jealousy,
and wild interference in Continental politics, by clogging
her with debt, and raising a host of European rivals to her
claim for universal commerce.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lowest organized race of any consequence in
Europe is the Sclavonic.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Sclavones came into contact with Roman civilization
earlier than the Goths; but, unlike the latter, they retired
to their settlements without carrying away any portion of
the manners and habits of the people whom they invaded.
Even yet they are but little advanced, since that early
epoch. At least till within the present century, the
Russian noble, as well as his serf, led the life of a pig,
eating, and drinking, and sleeping. Wallowing in filth,
insensate with brandy, and degraded by lust, the Russians
of various ranks differ only in the size and splendour of
their respective styes. To enter with minuteness into the
daily habits of all classes of both sexes would be to present
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>a picture which we should revolt from drawing, and the
reader from beholding.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Snubbo-Celestial form of the Sclavonic Nose stamps
its character irretrievably, and accords remarkably with
the description of the Sclavonic mind given by Kohl and
other recent writers:—“Inconsistent and unstable—wanting
in the creative faculty; but we cannot deny them
a marvellous aptitude for all kinds of work, and an extreme
facility of imitation.”<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c012'><sup>[47]</sup></a> This is just the description a
farmer might give of his horse, or a fine lady of her
monkey. “The hope of Europe,” says the same author,
“from Russian power consists in its total want of vigorous
characters, mighty minds, and moral energy.” The pictures
which the lively writer Kohl gives of the Russians—their
‘small shrewdness and fox-like common sense,’ their
impudent acknowledgment of their shameless cheating
and pedlaring dishonesty—accord literally with the indications
which we have ascribed to the Celestial Nose; but
we must refer the reader to his work on Russia for endless
confirmations of our assertion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Russia may rise above its present animal degradation,
but it will never take a high place in the history of civilization.
It may be doubted whether it will ever take any
station there at all, except when in some future and long
distant age, it is recorded, that, like Asia and Africa,
Europe fell from its palmy state, and became a heap of
ruins before the furious desolation of barbarous swarms
from the north.</p>

<p class='c007'>Napoleon said, with the prophetic vision of old experience,
for</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>that in fifty years Europe would be Republican or Cossack.
He only erred in using the disjunctive; for it does not
require much penetration to foresee that, at no very distant
period, Europe will be both—first Republican, and then,
when thus prostrated at the foot of the first powerful
despot—Cossack.</p>

<p class='c007'>For this purpose, it is probable the Sclavonian nations,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>with hordes of Mongolian Calmucks, and Tartars—the
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σιμοὶ</span>, or flat-nosed nations of Herodotus—are gathering
force and increasing in their vast plains and desolate
forests. The scourge of Europe—once the scourge of
Asia—is being prepared slowly but surely; and when
civilization shall have taken a firm hold of America and
the new continents gradually being built up in the Pacific,
Europe, having fulfilled its part in the world’s history, will
be swept away, and become a byword and a scorn among
the nations—‘Ichabod’ will be written on its temples, and
the bittern and the owl shall inhabit it; the wild beast of
the desert shall lie there, and the dragons in its pleasant
palaces.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Finnish race presents a remarkable proof of the
variation in physiognomy attendant on variation in mental
capacity, occasioned by change of circumstances—as
government, climate, and habits. The ancient Huns, the
modern Hungarians, and the northern Finns and Lapps of
the shores of the Bothnian Gulf and the White Sea, are
all of the same race; and yet differ widely from each
other in physiognomy and psychonomy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Few races exhibit greater or more remarkable differences
in mental cultivation, and in the direction of their
passions, according as they have been determined by the
degeneration of servitude, warlike ferocity, or a continual
striving for political freedom, than the Finns. In evidence
of this we need only refer to the now peaceful Finns of
the north, to the Huns, once celebrated for conquests that
disturbed the then existing order of things, and lastly, to a
great and noble people—the Magyars.”<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c012'><sup>[48]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The differences between those races took place within
the historic period, and afford a striking instance of the
effect of external circumstances in modifying the mental
and corporeal features.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fierce and savage Huns, who overran a portion of
the Roman Empire under Attila in the fifth century,
differed wholly from the Finns now existing in Europe.
So misshapen were their features, and so hideous their
aspect, so savage and demoniacal their warfare, that the
terrified Goths could not believe them to be born of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>woman, but asserted them to be the unnatural offspring of
demons and witches in the fearful solitudes of the icy
north. One of their distinctive features was a flat depressed
nose, plainly indicating their low organization.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although the Finns and Lapps retain the flat nose—never
having emerged from barbarism—they are a mild,
gentle, meek-spirited race, presenting few features which
seem capable of amelioration.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Hungarians, on the other hand—in whom, however,
we must suspect a large infusion of Gothic blood—are
a bold, independent, noble-minded, and highly intellectual
people; characteristics which exhibit themselves
in a noble Roman Nose, and a countenance bespeaking the
independence of their minds.</p>

<p class='c007'>We may next advert to the characteristic features of a
few of the Asiatic nations.</p>

<p class='c007'>Perhaps no nation displays a more universal dead level
and general sameness of feature than the Snub-nosed
Chinese. Notwithstanding the great varieties in climate
and soil which prevail in that extensive Empire, and the
correspondent variations which must be made in domestic
habits and style of living, a remarkable identity of feature
prevails among all classes of every province. The faces
may be said to be all cast in the same mould; and one
could wish that Nature, when she made the first cast, had—as
she is reported to have done when she made a certain
beautiful female, whose name we forget—broken the
mould before she produced any more casts from it.
Perhaps, however, we belie the good old dame in attributing
the production of this, or any other equally ugly
countenance, to her. It is rather the degraded form into
which a despotism of unknown duration and unexampled
soul-depressive powers has converted the original type.</p>

<p class='c007'>A form of government more admirably arranged to keep
the people in a state of childhood has never been modelled
than that of China. The wisdom of its arrangements for
securing the permanent despotism of the ruler is undeniably
proved by its long and peaceable subsistence.
To rebel in China is the heinous crime of filial disobedience:
it is not, as in Europe, a political crime merely,
it is also a moral crime of the same class as murder or
theft. Unless we can imagine a nation by universal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>assent throwing off the bonds of morality, and living in
confessedly gross crime, we can form no conception of
the Chinese rebelling. It would present the unnatural and
inconceivable state of a nation of parricides and disobedient
children.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every superior in China, from the Emperor to the
military officer or civil Mandarin, is “a father;” all under
him are his “children,” and as such must obey him without
question or demur. “Filial disobedience,” whether to
parents or governors, is the highest crime. Filial disobedience
is thus defined:—“In our general conduct not
to be orderly, is to fail in filial duty; in a Magistrate
not to be faithful, is to fail in filial duty: among friends,
not to be sincere, is to fail in filial duty: in arms and war,
not to be brave, is to fail in filial duty.” A people thus
treated as children, must ever remain in a state of childhood;
and though education is general among the Chinese,
it is an education which, like the bandages on their
women’s feet, binds their minds <em>from</em> growing, and
restricts them to the size and calibre of infancy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Education in China consists solely in social and political
training for the purposes of despotism. The studies are
confined to one unvaried routine, and no deviation from
the prescribed track is permitted. Within this circle all
are, and must be, educated. Hence an uniformity of
mind prevails, and has prevailed for ages throughout
China, and has extended itself to the national features;
betraying itself in Snub Noses and a dull, stolid expression
of countenance. So much for compulsory education!
It is impossible that it should be otherwise.</p>

<p class='c007'>A nation whose minds are all reduced to the same
level; whose thoughts are prescribed; whose daily conduct
is measured out; whose very amusements are dictated
by an imperial will, must necessarily soon become
uniform, both mentally and physically. This uniformity
will be the waveless level of the Dead Sea. Storms
may agitate the upper sky, winds may rage, and floods
descend; but the waves are too heavy to rise from
their death-like repose. They sleep the calm sleep, not
of peace, but of death. The last trumpet alone can
arouse their torpor. The benignant mind of the Christian
may nourish sweet hopes of evangelizing a nation so sunk.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>but the hopes are vain. Christianity came not till the
human mind was fitted and prepared to receive and understand
its divine precepts. It came not to the infancy of
the world, but to its old age and matured judgment. A
nation, therefore, steeped in the irreclaimable dotage of a
childhood which has endured throughout its whole life,
cannot receive it. Both the Hindoos and the Chinese have
forfeited by their long-lived puerility the blessed message.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first and every subsequent step of Christianity, as
of civilization, has been Westward. Neither can they
ever return to the East. The Apostle of the Gentiles
preached from Judea to Pamphylia and Galatia, but was
forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the Word in Asia;<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c012'><sup>[49]</sup></a>
and when he assayed to go Eastward into Bithynia, the
spirit suffered him not, but compelled him westerly into
Macedonia. From Macedonia to Rome; from Rome to
Gaul; from Gaul to Britain; from Britain to America and
Polynesia, the course has still ever been uniformly westward.<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c012'><sup>[50]</sup></a>
A few isolated Christians may be made in Asia;
but it will never be Christianized. Asia has performed
its part on the world’s stage. It is dead out, and cannot
be resuscitated. When Christianity is entertained by “all
nations,” Asia will be no more. It will not be reckonable
among the nations, even as a dead man is not among the
living. This may seem a harsh judgment. But is it
harsher that nations whose own degradation unfits them
for Christianity, shall remain ignorant of it during the
brief remainder of the world, than that they have been
ignorant of it for nearly two thousand years?</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not for man to judge God, and to say that his ways
are unjust. We must not deny the fact because we
cannot comprehend it. We cannot tell by what crimes
Asia has forfeited her part in the New Covenant of Grace.
It may be because she rejected the first dispensation, and
flagrantly violated the Old Covenant of Works. To Asia,
the mother of mankind, the blissful seat of our first
parents, the nurse of the renovated human race, were
given the first pure, simple precepts by which Man was
taught to obey his God as a child obeys his parent. How
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>soon she flung off this obedience and rejected her Great
Teacher let history, both sacred and profane, attest. Long
ere Asia sent forth peoples and nations to replenish other
quarters of the earth, these original precepts had been obscured
and obliterated by idolatry and polytheism. A
lesser crime, therefore, attached to these mis-instructed
offsprings than to the misteaching mother. A second dispensation
was therefore revealed to them, but forbidden to
her. So far man might think he comprehended the
divine purposes without impugning God’s wisdom and
justice; yet he may err, and his frail musings be but the
cogitations of the flea which reasons on the movements of
the elephant, whose back is his universe. This should be
the humble reflection of all who strive to justify the ways
of God to man. We know but in part, and we see but in
part, and therefore cannot judge of Him who sees and
knows the whole.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have incidentally mentioned the Hindoos as partaking
in the mental degradation of the Chinese. But,
nevertheless, they are not nearly so degraded a race, nor
have they so general an uniformity in their features, nor
so low a formation of their Noses. India has been subjected
to less uniformity of despotism than China. While
to the dominant system of the latter we can assign no
limit, we find in that of the former numerous epochs when
important changes have taken place.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fierce religious wars, frequent foreign invasions, domestic
feuds and intestine warfare have kept the Hindoo
mind more on the alert than that of China. Assyria,
Egypt, Scythia, Greece, Persia, and Britain have at different
epochs overwhelmed India. Idolatrous Monotheism,
Polytheism, Mahometanism and Christianity have, in turn,
violated its shrines, and endeavoured to overwhelm both
Buddha and Brahma. Buddha and Brahma, Vishnu and
Siva, have striven to overthrow each other; but while the
country has been desolated, the people have been saved
from sinking into the uniform degradation of the Chinese.
Nevertheless, under each and every system, despotism has
prevailed in India; no free institution has ever flourished
on its plains; and, therefore, despite the stirring events
which have excited it, it has never risen again to that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>high station which its people must have held among their
contemporaries when they sculptured the caves of Elephanta
and Ellora, and raised the pyramidal pagodas of
Tanjore and Deogur.</p>

<p class='c007'>These gigantic works sufficiently attest that the inhabitants
of India are not naturally of a low-class race.
Forty thousand men labouring incessantly for forty years
would hardly suffice to excavate and sculpture the cavern-temples
of Salsette alone. Yet those form but a small
portion of similar gigantic works of the same age.</p>

<p class='c007'>No mean-minded men raised fanes such as these to the
Deity. Energy of the most vigorous character, talent of
the highest rank, and devotion of the noblest nature, could
alone have dictated and executed structures which outvie
in magnitude the boldest efforts of modern genius. In
comparing them with the latter, we should moreover
recollect that they were the first efforts of the human race;
made without pattern, designed without exemplar, and
commenced and carried out without experience.</p>

<p class='c007'>How different must those men have been from the soft
and effeminate Hindoo who has forgotten in the mist of
ages these shrines of his fathers, and abandoned them to
ruin and decay; and who, conscious of his own utter
inability to achieve or conceive their equals, ascribes their
formation to giants and demigods. And they were different.
The same race, but different men, different in
features as in minds. While the profile of the modern
Hindoo is soft and effeminate, and the Nose short and
rounded (parabolic), the ancient sculptures demonstrate
that the profile of their earliest progenitors was manly and
decided, and identical with that of their descendants, the
Indo-Germanic nations, in Europe. One well-known
instance will suffice. The Trimurti or three-headed deity
in the caves of Elephanta.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is a sculpture of the most remote antiquity, but the
dress, the beads, the sacred cord and other religious symbols
declare it to be the work of Hindoos. In anthropomorphising
the Deity, men always adopt their own typical
countenance for that of their God. Hence their idols
betray the national features. Now, observe the profiles of
Vishnu and Siva in this Trimurti. The face of the former,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>the good and beneficent “Preserver,” the friend and
mediator for man, is a purely Greek face; the Nose
straight and well-defined. It has none of the air of the
modern Hindoo countenance. Much less has that of the
energetic and terrible Siva, “the Destroyer.” The Nose
is of the most energetic form; it is a fine Roman Nose,
aquiline and rugose. If phrenologists are permitted from
similar facts to say that the Greeks—who were but children
to these Hindoo artists—were phrenologists, surely
we may venture to say that even at this very early period
the Hindoos were Nasologists.</p>

<p>THE HINDOO TRIMURTI.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>But in the wide nostril of Brahma we also perceive the
Cogitative form of Nose, so necessary to indicate the
wisdom of Brahma, “the Creator:” who, though now he
rests, having consigned the inferior office of Preservation
to Vishnu, was the first emanation from the supreme
Brahmè, and by whom and from whom all creation proceeded.
With the exception of the head in this Trimurti,
Brahma has no idolatrous representations, for it is said in
the Vedas, “Of Him whose glory is so great, there is no
image. He is the incomprehensible Being which illumines
all, delights all, and whence all proceed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Sir William Jones mentions, in one of his discourses
published in the Asiatic Researches, the existence of a
small nation in India which appears distinct from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>Hindoo race. The people comprising it he describes as
shrewd, clever tradesmen, enterprising merchants, acute
money-lenders, and notorious in India for their aptitude
for commerce. Their countenances, he adds, are what are
called Jewish, and hence he concludes that they constitute
a portion of Jews, who either at the dispersion of the
Ten Tribes, or at some other very early period, settled in
India. It is surprising that the acute President should
have so hastily jumped to such a conclusion from the foregoing
premises; for he adds a fact which seems most
decidedly to negative it. This people, he tells us, have
not the slightest trace of any Jewish traditions, belief, or
customs among them. Now it is a familiar fact that the
Jews, wherever dispersed, or however long separated from
their brethren, have invariably retained a very large proportion
of the inspired precepts revealed to regulate their
religious, moral, and social conduct; and it must demand
the most precise and indisputable evidence to justify the
classing any people as Jews, who have lost all traces of
the manners and customs of that singular nation.</p>

<p class='c007'>For these reasons we do not hesitate to say that the two
facts on which Sir W. Jones founded his hasty hypothesis,
viz. the commercial character and the Jewish physiognomy
of this Asiatic tribe, afford by their coincidence only a
remarkable and curious confirmation of our Nasological
theory, and as such, we here gladly insert it.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have said that the Jewish Nose should more properly
be called the Syrian Nose; but have reserved, until
this place, some of the corroborative illustrations.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Syrian Arabs, as descendants of Abraham, through
the wild son of Hagar, inherit the physical, and many of
the metaphysical, features of the Hebrew nation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Destined, by the promise of God, to become a great
nation, the Arabs founded one of the most extensive kingdoms
of the earth, and for many centuries swayed an
empire more extensive than that of Rome in her fullest
prosperity. For twelve hundred years, a larger proportion
of the inhabitants of the earth have devoutly obeyed the
precepts of the Arabian prophet, than have knelt at the
altar of any other individual creed; and, though Mahometanism
is perhaps doomed to fall before Christianity, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>cannot be regarded in any other light than as a minor dispensation,
and an inferior blessing conferred by Providence
on a very large proportion of His people.</p>

<p class='c007'>Christians who yet recognize the finger of God in every
sublunary affair, would shrink with horror if asked to
recognize in Mahometanism a Providential dispensation;
yet, whether we regard it as a religion which annihilated
the grossest idolatries, abolished human sacrifices, exterminated
the vilest obscenities, and substituted a nearly
spiritual worship of One God, over the largest and fairest
portion of the earth,—or as the religion of a nation, whose
ancestor God blessed, and promised to “make a great
nation,” and “to multiply exceedingly, that it should not
be numbered for multitude;” and who, in token thereof,
received the seal of circumcision—to this day retained, as
among the Jews—it is difficult not to see in it the finger
of God, or to deny that the pseudo-prophet of the sons of
Ishmael was an unconscious instrument for good in His
hands.</p>

<p class='c007'>But this is a topic not needful for us here to enter fully
upon. It is more to our purpose to remark upon the
psychonomic features of the Arabs, while in the zenith of
their promised glory as a nation;<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c012'><sup>[51]</sup></a> when the Caliphs of the
East ruled as Priest and Potentate over more than two-thirds
of the known globe.</p>

<p class='c007'>During this glorious period of their power, the Arab
character shone out uncontrolled in its true features, and
exhibited itself as it had never done before, nor since.</p>

<p class='c007'>True to its parentage, but unshackled by the stringent
laws and anti-social ceremonies of its more favoured
brother, it rioted in all those tastes and pursuits which the
latter delighted in, but was restrained from; and became
celebrated for a splendour which was rivalled by that of
Solomon alone, and a traffic which far outvied that of all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>contemporaries or predecessors—except, perhaps, the cognate
nation—the Phœnicians.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rich in barbaric pearls and gold, and boasting all the
wealth of Ormuz and of Ind, the court of the Caliphs
verified the visions of the “Arabian Nights;” which, if
true, were true here only. All the gauds and trinkets,
the golden palaces, the jewelled walls, the glittering roofs,
in which the other branch<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c012'><sup>[52]</sup></a> of the Hebrew nation displayed
their highest ideas of magnificence, shone resplendent
in the halls of the Caliphs.</p>

<p class='c007'>But as to the boasted literature of the Arabs, it resolves
itself into an ardent pursuit of physical science—astronomy,
chemistry, and the mechanical arts, for nearly all the
more important of which we are indebted to the Arabs;
not, however, as inventors, but as carriers, like the
Phœnicians. In the higher departments of literature, the
Arabs made no progress. Metaphysical disquisitions and
intellectual pursuits were repugnant to their tastes, which
rather delighted in the physics of Aristotle than the metaphysics
of Plato.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nor were they less true to their nasal development in
their success and skill in commercial pursuits. The commerce
of Arabia, for several centuries, encircled the whole
known world. From the frigid shores of Scandinavia,
from the torrid sands of Africa, from silken Cathay, from
jewelled Ceylon, from vine-clad Europe, from spicy Araby,
flowed the rich streams of produce. The amber of the
north was exchanged for the gold of the south; the wines
of Spain for the silks of China; the pearls of Ceylon for
the slaves and gold-dust of Africa; and a commerce now
excelled only by that of England, carried arts and literature
from one end of the Old World to the other, and was
mainly instrumental in raising the more highly-organized
nations of Europe from barbarism to a physical and intellectual
splendour hitherto unknown.</p>

<p class='c007'>But from this glorious reality, the Arab has sunk into a
wretched, irretrievable lethargy. Like the Jew, he has
been weighed in the balance and found wanting; the cup
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>of promise has been held to his lips, and he has refused, or
polluted the blessed draught. They have been called, but
would not come, they would have been gathered together
as tender chickens under the wings of the hen, but they
would not; and “behold, their house is left unto them
desolate.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Neither Arab nor Jew shall ever again revive, till they
join with the whole earth in one universal cry, “Blessed
is He that cometh in the name of the Lord!”</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been said that Christian intolerance has driven
the Jew into the mart, and sunk his soul in barter. But
this is not true—Commerce and money-getting are the
psychonomic features of both the Hebrew races. The
Israelitish branch is vehemently charged with its usury
and extortion, by all its prophets. The severe laws which
Moses made against usury shew the character of the people
for whom they were necessary; yet those laws were ineffectual
to check this inherent vice. Ezekiel (ch. xxii. 12)
exclaims, “Thou hast taken usury and increase, and thou hast
greedily gained of thy neighbours by extortion, and hast
forgotten me, saith the Lord God;” so all the prophets.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Arab and the Jew are both now equally sunk in
the same degradation, (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Heu! quantum mutati!</span></i>) and both
exhibit, through this degradation, their love of gold,
though in a different manner. The Arab still haunting
his native soil, from which legitimate commerce is almost
excluded, betrays his ruling passion in extortion from
travellers, in skilful chicanery in horse-dealing—the only
commerce left to him—or in impudent incessant demands
on strangers for <em>bacsheesh</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>All travellers agree, that when the Arab, degraded as he
is, has an opportunity, there is no shrewder or more
skilful bargain-maker, nor any one more competent to
extract by ingenious chaffering, the full equivalent for his
services. He has been designated by fleeced and angry
travellers—little thinking how near the mark they were—the
Jew of the desert. The modern Jew, driven from
the land of his birth into a wider sphere, exercises his
commercial propensities in similar pursuits, and under
every clime; and amidst every race, out-manœuvres and
surpasses his less shrewd antagonist.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>Other Asiatic nations might seem to call for observation;
but so little is known of their mental characteristics, that
it would be improper to endeavour to substantiate our
cause by them.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is unnecessary to do more than remind the reader of
the low development of the Negro mind and his miserable
nasal conformation—they are worthy of each other.
However humane may be the attempts to elevate the
Negro, it can never be done till his Nose is more elongated;
but as its present form has subsisted without alteration for
three or four thousand years, there does not seem much
hope of its being improved now. The Negro race, as old
as the earliest Egyptian sculptures, has never risen to an
equality with any of the other races; and, though we
would not willingly condemn any nation to hopeless degradation,
yet the history of the Past <em>will</em> reveal somewhat
of the secrets of the Future, and he is a fool who
cannot, and a coward who dare not, read them.</p>

<p class='c007'>As among individuals, so among nations there are
orders and degrees of mind, and it is only the blind who
cannot see that the equality of the one is as wild a dream
as the equality of the other.</p>

<p class='c007'>No well-informed writer, however warm his sympathies
towards the Negro race as his relation by the same “blood
of which God made all the dwellers upon earth,” has anticipated
a destiny for it equal to that of the Caucasian or
elliptical-headed and aquiline-nosed races. Channing, the
most enthusiastic friend of the blacks, in all the fervour of
his ardent mind and vivid imagination, attributes to them
a capacity only for the milder graces of Christianity, and
accords to them a destiny precisely such as is indicated by
their nasal formation when elevated and sanctified by religion.
“I should expect,” he says, “from the African
race, if civilized, less energy, less courage, less intellectual
originality, than in ours; but more amiableness, tranquillity,
gentleness, and content. They might not rise to
an equality in outward condition, but would probably be a
much happier race.” Essentially a feminine character is
that which he assigns the negro; a character very loveable,
notwithstanding the deformity of its facial indicator.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the new Islands of the Pacific, we behold a constant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>succession of new worlds emerging from the deep by means
of the same process which, in the pre-Adamite world,
formed and elevated the islands and continents of the
northern hemisphere. Minute polypi are secreting from
the waters, and fixing on the summits of submarine volcanoes
the solid and durable limestone which now forms
their protection from the waves, and which will hereafter
form the foundations on which accumulated detritus will
heap up fertile soils and habitable lands.<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c012'><sup>[53]</sup></a> Earthquakes
are continually pushing up these horizontal surfaces, and
breaking them up into mountains which, arresting the
clouds in their progress, draw down into the valleys and
plains the fertilizing rain. This smooths down the asperities
of the earthquake-broken surface, and softens and
harmonizes into that sweet variety which gives birth to</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The pleasure situate in hill and dale.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>To people these new lands, Nature has branched off
from the old stock, new races of men of various degrees of
physical development and mental endowments. While
those nearest the old continent of Asia, and therefore
nearest to the old blood, are of the lowest possible mental
and physical organization, little elevated above the low-class
animals—the kangaroo and the ornithorynchus<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c012'><sup>[54]</sup></a>—of
the Australian plains, those at a greater distance—the
New Zealander and the Otaheitan—exhibit a development
which may vie with that of the Caucasian nations: and
which has proved its equality by not sinking before them,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>but maintaining against Saxon invaders equal rights and
equal privileges.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have a striking instance of this before us at the
present time. The British Legislature having, in ignorance
of the determined character and clever good sense of
the New Zealanders, endeavoured to force upon them a
Constitution which deprived them of legislative privileges
equal with those of the colonists, and which gave to the
latter the power of taxing the former without their consent,
the natives have resisted the injustice so firmly, but
hitherto peaceably, that the Governor, Sir George Grey,
has been compelled to suspend this so-called Constitution,
lest it<a id='t149'></a> should foment a war of the most deadly character.
It is worthy of observation that the injustice attempted to
be done this shrewd and spirited people, is not one of an
evident physical character, such as any savage can appreciate,
but one of a purely theoretical and political nature,
the importance of which is even yet hardly sufficiently
understood and appreciated in any country besides England.
Sir George Grey writes to the Home Government
as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>“By the introduction of the proposed Constitution into
the provinces of New Zealand, her Majesty’s Ministers
would not confer, as it was intended, upon her subjects
the blessings of self-government, but would be giving
power to a small minority (the colonists). She would not
be giving to her subjects the right to manage their affairs
as they might think proper, but would be giving to a small
<em>minority a power to raise taxes from the great majority</em> (the
aborigines). There was no reason to think that the majority
of the aboriginal inhabitants would be satisfied with
the rule of the minority; while there are many reasons
for believing that they would resist to the uttermost.
They were people of <em>strong natural sense and ability</em>, but by
nature jealous and suspicious. Many of them were owners
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>of vessels, horses, and cattle, and had considerable sums of
money at their disposal, <em>and there was no people he was
acquainted with less likely to sit down quietly under what
they might regard as an injustice</em>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“For these and other reasons, the Governor announced
that he should not proclaim the constitution before receiving
fresh instructions from the Colonial Office.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The tone of the most trustworthy correspondence from
New Zealand, proves that this exercise of independent
authority on the part of Governor Grey has saved the
colony from disastrous consequences. Ministers acknowledge
his superior competency to judge in a matter of this
kind, and a bill has accordingly been introduced into the
House of Commons by Mr. Labouchere, ‘for suspending,
during a limited time (viz., for five years), the operation
of part of the Act for making further provision for the
government of the New Zealand Islands.’”<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c012'><sup>[55]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Thus has this noble people, with a strong natural sense
and ability not hitherto supposed to belong innately to
“savages,” opposed more successfully the first step in
tyranny—the power of unrepresented taxation—than any
other nation (except the Saxon), which has ever existed,
civilized or uncivilized.</p>

<p class='c007'>This has been done within twenty years after their
actual beneficial contact with civilization; but it was more
than six hundred years after the Norman conquest, before
the Saxon roused himself to enforce the same right of self-taxation.
There could be but one better evidence than
this of the high-class mind of this people; and it has
furnished this one better, and best, evidence—its speedy
and conscientious reception of Christianity; for “in no
country, similarly circumstanced, has the Gospel made
such rapid progress, since the days of the Apostles.”<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c012'><sup>[56]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>While for several centuries missionaries of every denomination
have laboured in Asia in vain, no sooner was
Christianity efficiently made known to the New Zealanders,
than, catching at once with a remarkable aptitude its
leading characteristics, and appreciating immediately its
beneficent doctrines, they accepted it; and now, together
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>with other Polynesian islands, New Zealand affords the
proudest conquest and the richest harvest of the soldier of
Christ.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yet, apparently, for no nation could Christianity be less
adapted, and no nation could be expected to afford less
hope of speedy conversion. The pagan New Zealander
was a fierce, blood-thirsty monster, spending his whole
life, and finding all his pleasures, in the most savage warfare.
Not content with slaying his enemies in combat, he
sat down afterwards, with a joyous enthusiasm worthy of
a fiend, to make a feast on their carcasses. Human sacrifices
stained his altars, and hideously deformed images
pourtrayed his debased notions of a God.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the other hand, the peaceable and mild Hindoos,
whose religion forbids bloody sacrifices of any kind, and
enjoins the careful preservation of the spirit of life, even
in the meanest forms; whose singular traditions of the
incarnate Chreeshna seem to point distinctly to a Messiah,
and whose remarkable Trimurti, “three in one, and one
in three,” seems to open a way to the facile reception of
the mysterious doctrine of a Trinity in Unity, have never,
as a nation, a province, or even a small village, embraced
Christianity.<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c012'><sup>[57]</sup></a> China, which has its similar traditions,
whose sages have taught that “The true Holy One is to
be found in the West,” and that “Eternal reason (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λόγος</span>)
produced One, One produced Two, Two produced Three,
and <span class='sc'>Three</span> produced all things,” and whose calm stoicism
and severe morality are so accordant with the external
symptoms of a Christian mind, has hardly furnished a
single convert, and apparently feels no curiosity about the
religion of the Fanqui (white devils).</p>

<p class='c007'>If history is the past teaching lessons to the future,
surely our Missionary Societies might take a lesson from
these facts, and withdraw their exertions from so hopeless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>a field as Asia, and expend them on the hopeful soil of
Polynesia. Surely if the great Apostle of the Gentiles,
who was specially appointed to bring into the fold of
Christ “all nations,” was forbidden to preach the Word to
the effete nations of Asia, it is not given to his successors
to contravene the inspired mandate.</p>

<p class='c007'>Other injunctions of Scripture to the apostolic Church
are rightly interpreted as applicable, and to be obeyed by
the Church in all future ages; and it is a strange inconsistency,
arising from a too warm and enthusiastic desire
to promote the kingdom of Christ, fruitlessly to strive, in
this instance, against the mandate of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus much have we said, to contrast the New Zealand
mind with the Hindoo and the Chinese, because the same
contrast is manifest in their respective physiognomies.</p>

<p>NEW ZEALANDER.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Compare the bold energetic Roman Nose, the manly and
commanding profile of the New Zealander, with the soft
and rounded features of the Hindoo, and the flat monotonous
surface of the Chinese visage. You perceive at a
glance that the first is the face of a man of strong, straight-forward,
common sense, and intense energy. He may not
be an acute and subtle reasoner; but he catches at once
the leading points of a subject, instantly decides, and
instantly acts upon his decision.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>While the two latter remain in imperturbable absorption,
and while the subtle “Greek” would be thinking too precisely

<p class='c019'>the “Roman” has been, and seen, and conquered. He is
come back, at home, resting after his successful toil; while
the “Snub” is thinking about getting out of bed, and the
“Greek” is making up his mind whether it is “worth
while” to go out.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus we have, from divers sources, brought together,
briefly and succinctly, a few of the universal proofs which
establish Nasology as a science. From individuals and
from nations we have gathered the basis of our nasological
laws; and we trust we have produced conviction in some
minds that “the Nose is an index to Character;” if not,
we shall not say to the reader, as phrenologists do to their
incredulous auditors, that it arises from his defective organization,
but rather attribute it to our own defective mode
of argumentation; for we shall not willingly admit the
erroneousness of a system which has been built up upon
many years of personal observation both among the dead
and among the living.</p>

system is entitled to be called a science, or only a theory or hypothesis.
Thus both the advocates and the opponents of phrenology or
geology might agree to call them noögenisms. For this reason we
apply the word here to geology, which some persons assert to be more
than a mere hypothesis, while others deny its claim to be called a
science. At present we claim for Nasology no higher title than that
of a mental deduction from facts or noögenism.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r44'>44</a>. “In 1846, which was a year of larger emigration than any that
preceded, it amounted to 129,851. But in the year 1847, the emigration
extended to no less than 258,270 persons, almost the whole
of them being Irish emigrants to North America. It is scarcely
necessary to observe, that history records no single transportation at
all to compare with this. The migrations of classical antiquity were
only the slow oozings of infant tribes from one thinly-peopled district
into another rather less peopled, or rather more fertile. In actual
figures, the irruptions from the north into southern Europe were
never at one time more immense.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The Government only refrained from assisting this tremendous
emigration at the urgent demand of the land-owners, because it was
going on as fast as possible without its aid. Bad legislation had
driven the Celt to the ocean, and Saxon ingenuity had furnished him
a boat to cross it. Famine and pestilence were at his heels. It was
unnecessary to do more. What drowning wretch will not catch at a
straw? What patient idiot not fly from misery and death? Yet
how monstrous to call such flight—‘the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sauve qui peut</span></i> of a panic-stricken
army’ spontaneous!</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was the <em>unavoidable</em> misfortune of this emigration to be
<em>entirely spontaneous</em>. The cry was—‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sauve qui peut!</span></i>’ To send
out more emigrants at the public expense, or to promise assistance to
all who should emigrate, would only have been adding fuel to the
fire, or like attempting to expedite the movement of a crowd locked
in a narrow passage, by applying fresh numbers and pressure to its
rear. A miserable necessity dictated that, as a general rule, emigration
should be allowed to retain its spontaneous, unassisted character.&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* The fever, <em>it is a painful satisfaction to reflect</em>,
raged with equal force in all the British vessels, whether well or ill-provisioned
and appointed. Fearful, too, as the loss of life was, both
at sea and on landing, <em>it was not greater than was reasonably to be
expected</em> from the mortality which prevailed, under circumstances
rather less unfavourable for health, in the workhouses and other accumulations
of Irish at home.”—<cite>Times, Jan. 1848.</cite></p>

<p class='c007'>History, in its blackest pages, records nothing more horrible than
the miseries of the passage; yet while we are maudlin over the
horrors of the slave-trade, we “reflect, with a painful satisfaction,
and reasonably expect” the more dreadful sufferings of our fellow-citizens.
The slave-dealer—before the Abolition made it necessary to
stow three cargoes in one ship—calculated to land at their destination
four-fifths of his cargo; and it was thought sufficiently
shocking that 1 in 5 died on the passage. But the mortality on
board the Irish emigrant-ships was greater. Many vessels, from
their rotten state, perished altogether, with from 200 to 300 passengers.
This rarely happens with a slaver, as the vessels are
necessarily of the very best construction. But, of those who
escaped shipwreck, 1 in 3, and 1 in 4 died on the passage from fever,
and one half the remainder suffered from disease. The “Laren”
from Sligo sailed with 440 passengers—108 died and 150 were sick.
The “Virginius” sailed with 496 passengers—158 died, 186 were sick,
and the remainder landed feeble and tottering. It could hardly be
otherwise, when vessels built to pack 200 emigrants sailed with twice
that number; so that they are described to be worse than the blackhole
of Calcutta. And this was the emigration which the British
parliament—which laboured to put down the slave-trade—declared
itself willing to encourage, had it been necessary, from any backwardness
in the wretched Celts, to avail themselves of it, and which a
British Minister coolly declared it would have been inhuman and
unjust to interfere with.</p>

of Australia their labours extend for 1000 miles in length; averaging
a quarter of a mile in breadth, and one hundred and fifty feet in
depth. The geologist, in contemplating these stupendous operations,
learns to appreciate the circumstances by which were deposited, in
ancient times, those mountain-masses of limestone, for the most part
coralline, which abound in many parts of our native island.”—<cite>Ansted’s

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
